In recent years, cardiorenal protection\nstudies have made signiﬁcant progress in patients with CKD, and\nthe introduction of sodium-glucose cotransporter protein 2\n(SGLT2) inhibitors in particular has provided an important new\ntool in the treatment of CKD (1, 2). These inhibitors target SGLT2,\nwhich is responsible for the reabsorption of glucose and sodium in\nthe proximal tubules of the kidneys. SGLT2 inhibitors lower glucose\nlevels and blood pressure by lowering the renal threshold for\nglucose excretion and by promoting negative salt and water\nhomeostasis. They also have an effect on glomerular\nhemodynamics, leading to a decrease in glomerular ﬁltration rate,\nwhich is reversible when treatment is stopped. This phenomenon is\nknown as “glomerular feedback”. In type 2 diabetes mellitus\n(T2DM), SGLT2 inhibitors affect glomerular ultraﬁltration by\ndecreasing vascular resistance and inducing vasodilation. In\naddition, these inhibitors reduce ﬁbrosis in the proximal tubule\nby decreasing energy expenditure and inhibiting the mammalian\ntarget of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (3). Another growing area of\nresearch is the ability of SGLT2 inhibitors to induce a fasting state\n(4). All of these effects reduce cellular stress and inﬂammation in\ncardiac and renal\nto be the\npathophysiologic reason for the beneﬁcial effects of SGLT2\ninhibitors on cardiac and renal function (1).\ntissues, which is thought\nSGLT2 inhibitors, including canagliﬂozin, dapagliﬂozin, and\nempagliﬂozin, are widely approved antihyperglycemic agents that\nimprove insulin resistance (IR) (5), and are used to reduce glycemia\nand cardiovascular risk in T2DM patients (6). Large clinical trials\nprovide compelling evidence to support their beneﬁcial effects on major\nadverse cardiovascular events, hospitalization for heart failure (7–11)\nand renal outcomes (12, 13). However, studies on genetic variants\nrelated to SGLT2 inhibitors’ renoprotective effects are limited. The\nSLC5A2 gene encodes SGLT2, crucial for renal glucose reabsorption.\nDespite promising results in clinical studies, challenges such as variable\npatient responses and long-term effects remain. Addressing these\nchallenges is essential to optimize clinical application.\nIn the ﬁeld of precision medicine, ﬁnding effective molecular\ntargets is a key task. Traditional methods to study the mechanism of\naction of target proteins through pharmacology are inefﬁcient and\ntime-consuming. The drug target Mendelian randomization (MR) has\nemerged as a novel and powerful research method. Novel methods\nsuch as gene co-localization and gene variants associated with drug\ntarget mRNA expression (expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)) can\nbe used to create MR tool variables for drug exposure (14). The eQTL is\na type of expressed quantitative trait locus, which can be classiﬁed into\ncis-eQTL and trans-eQTL by analyzing the relationship between the\namount of gene expression and the locus. The former regulates genes\nthat are closer together, while the latter regulates genes that are farther\napart. Drug target MR utilizes genetic instrumental variables to explore\nthe causal relationship between molecules and diseases. This approach\nis based on the downstream products of target proteins, using Single\nNucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) near the coding genes of the target\nproteins that have signiﬁcant effects on these downstream products\n(protein Quantitative Trait Loci (pQTL) or eQTL) as the instrumental\nvariables. The concentration of the downstream products of the target\nproteins serves as the exposure, while disease serves as the endpoint.\nMR is then performed to verify the effect of the target proteins on the\nstudied diseases, providing new ideas for drug development and effect\nprediction. This strategy can be used to investigate the biological\nmechanism of the effect of SGLT2 inhibition on eGFR.\nGiven that the genetic mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibition in CKD\nprotection are poorly understood, we hypothesized that SGLT2\ninhibitors may be causally related to eGFR. Therefore, our study\nwas designed to assess the genetic causal effect of SGLT2 inhibition\non eGFR. We performed a two-sample MR analysis using genetic\nvariants associated with SLC5A2 gene expression and hemoglobin\nA1c (HbA1c) levels as instrumental variables. This helps to expand\nour understanding of the mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitors in renal\nprotection and provides evidence for this.\n2 Methods\n2.1 Study design\nFigure 1 illustrates a schematic of the study design. The study\nwas conducted in the following ﬁve steps: 1) Genetic variants\nrepresenting the effects of SGLT2 inhibition were selected as\ninstrumental variables. 2) Pooled GWAS data for T2DM was\nselected as a positive control. 3) The outcome factor, eGFR, was\nFrontiers in Endocrinology\n02\nfrontiersin.org"},{"page":3,"text":"Liu\n10.3389/fendo.2024.1418575\nFIGURE 1\nDrug-targeted MR study design.

Genetic variants representing SLC5A2 gene expression levels were selected by screening cis-eQTLs\nwith a genotype frequency of less than 5×10^-8. These variants inﬂuence SLC5A2 gene expression at the RNA transcription level. The expression\nfurther affects protein levels, which in turn inﬂuence HbA1c levels. Thus, different expression levels of the SLC5A2 gene can mimic the therapeutic\neffects of SGLT2 inhibitors (glucose-lowering effects, reduced HbA1c). We studied the impact of these varying expression levels on eGFR.\nselected. 4) MR analyses were performed to estimate the causal\neffects of SGLT2 inhibition on eGFR.\n2.2 Data sources\n2.2.1 Selection of genetic variants of\nSGLT2 inhibitors\nThe process of selecting genetic variants for SGLT2 inhibitors is\ndescribed in detail in the study of Xu M. et al. (15). It involves four\nsteps: First, genetic variants associated with SLC5A2 gene expression\nwere selected by Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) (16) and\neQTLGen Consortium (17) data; second, the correlation of each\nSLC5A2 variant with HbA1c levels was assessed using UK Biobank\ndata (18); then, the causal variants of SLC5A2 with HbA1c were\nveriﬁed by the co-localization method (10); and ﬁnally, six genetic\nvariants closely associated with HbA1c and SGLT2 inhibition were\nscreened for MR analysis by the standard clustering process and F-\nstatistic estimation (Supplementary Table 1).\nTABLE 1 Description of GWAS data sources.\n2.2.2 Study outcome\nThe GWAS data used in this study included the year of\npublication, sample size, SNP counts, and population information,\nas detailed in Table 1. The outcome GWAS data in this study were\nextracted from specialized disease databases. GWAS data for T2DM\nwere obtained from the Diabetes Genetics Replication and Meta-\nanalysis (DIAGRAM) consortium, and GWAS data for eGFR were\nobtained from the CKDGen consortium.\n2.2.2.1 Positive control data\nPositive control MR analysis justiﬁes the genetic tool of a drug\nby demonstrating the expected effect on an outcome that has an\nestablished causal relationship with the target drug (19). SGLT2\ninhibitors are used as a glucose-lowering drug with the intended\nindication of T2DM. Therefore, T2DM GWAS pooled data was\nselected as a positive control. The T2DM data in this study was\nobtained from one of the largest diabetes case-control studies\npublished in 2022 in the DIAGRAM consortium.

The GWAS meta-analysis included 22\nGWAS studies involving 180,834 patients with T2DM and 492,191\ncontrols, as well as ﬁve lineage groups (51.1% of European\nancestry) (20).\nMR analyses were performed using the Mendelian randomization R\npackage and the TwoSampleMR R package (github.com/MRCIEU/\nTwoSampleMR). We plotted the results as forest plots using code\nfrom the ggplot 2 package in R.\n2.2.2.2 Study outcome data\nGenetic associations for eGFR were obtained from a meta-\nanalysis of publicly available CKDGen studies (21). All participants\nwere of European ancestry, with a mean age of 54 years. All genetic\ncorrelations were adjusted for sex, age, study center, genetic\nrationale, components, correlations, and other study-speciﬁc\ncharacteristics (22). To conﬁrm the robustness of the results of\nthis study, we performed MR analysis using eGFR meta-analysis\nGWAS data from a diverse ancestry cohort (n ≥ 61 studies) and\nfrom a European ancestry cohort (n ≥ 42 studies).

Also, this\ndata has been integrated into the GWAS Catalog database\n(GCST90103633, GCST90103634) (Table 1).\nThe GWAS summary statistics used in this study can be found in\nthe IEU OpenGWAS project (https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/), the GTEx\nportal (https://www.gtexportal.org/), the eQTLGen consortium\n(https://eqtlgen.org/), the DIAGRAM consortium (https://\ndiagram-consortium.org/), CKDGen (https://ckdgen.imbi.uni-\nfreiburg.de/), UKB Research (https://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank,\nukb-d-30750_irnt), and the GWAS Catalog (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/\ngwas/downloads/summary-statistics, GCST008058, GCST008064,\nGCST90103633, GCST90103634).\n2.3 Statistical analysis\nIn the ﬁrst place, genetic variant screening for SGLT2 inhibitors\napplied a generalized inverse variance weighting (IVW) method to\nconsider the correlation of six predictors. MR effects were estimated\nby the LD matrix and IVW and MR-Egger methods to improve the\nefﬁciency and stability of the analysis (24). Subsequently, in MR\nanalysis, the IVW method was used as the primary method to\nexplore the effect of SGLT2 inhibition on the positive control T2DM\nand the study outcome eGFR (19). Various methods (including\nMR-Egger, weighted median, simple, and weighted models) were\napplied to test the reliability and stability of the results. The\nStrengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in\nEpidemiology-Mendelian Randomization (STROBE-MR)\nguidelines were applied to guide the design of this study and the\nwriting of the results (19). All statistical analyses were performed\nusing the “Two-sample MR” (version 0.5.6) and “MR” (version\n0.5.1) packages in the R software (version 4.3.2) environment. To\nmore accurately interpret causality, we set the level of statistical\nsigniﬁcance to the Bonferroni-corrected level, that is, P < 0.0083. All\nAs a sensitivity analysis, we applied an independent validation with\na separate dataset. The validation data came from GWAS pooled data\nfrom another CKDGen meta-analysis, details of which are shown\nin Table 1.\nTo control for heterogeneity, we applied the MR multivalent\nresiduals and outliers (MR-PRESSO) method. To test potential MR\nhypotheses, such as assessing the effect of directional pleiotropy, we\napplied the generalized MR-Egger regression method. Both tests of\npleiotropy using the MR-Egger intercept term and tests of\nheterogeneity among predictors (Cochran Q statistic for IVW and\nglobal test for MR-PRESSO) were used to quantify the level of\npleiotropy in the MR analysis. Compared to the MR-Egger, the MR-\nPRESSO method has higher accuracy for identifying levels of\nmultivalence and outliers (25). The stability of outliers and results\nwas also tested using the leave-one-out sensitivity analysis method,\nfunnel plots, and scatter plots.\nFor a more rigorous interpretation of causality, we also used the\nBonferroni correction based on the number of SNPs analyzed in\nthe ﬁnal MR. We used the signiﬁcance level after performing the\nBonferroni correction, which was set at 0.0083 (0.05 divided by 6\nSNPs), to control for the rate of false discovery of multiple\ncomparisons. In each independent SNP analysis, we compared the\nP value to 0.0083 to determine whether statistical signiﬁcance existed.\n3 Results\n3.1 Effect of positive control-SLC5A2\non T2DM\nTo conduct a positive control, T2DM GWAS data were selected\nas outcome data and analyzed using MR with SLC5A2. As shown in\nTable 2, the MR results indicated that a 1-SD increase in HbA1c\nregulated by SLC5A2 was associated with an 83% increase in the risk\nof T2DM (IVW OR 1.83, 95% CI: 1.180-2.846, p = 0.007). This\nresult effectively mimics the pharmacological inhibition mechanism\nof SGLT2 inhibitors, demonstrating that SGLT2 inhibition reduces\nthe risk of T2DM. SGLT2 inhibitors, as glucose-lowering drugs,\nhave an established causal relationship with T2DM, and the results\nof the positive control analysis were consistent with the expected\noutcomes. This suggests that SGLT2 inhibition decreases the risk of\nT2DM and demonstrates that the target gene, SLC5A2, can serve as\na genetic tool for the drug target of SGLT2 inhibitors.\n3.2 Effect of SLC5A2 on eGFR\nThe IVW method showed evidence to support a causal\nassociation between SLC5A2 and eGFR (Table 2, Figures 2, 3).

This suggests that each 1-SD increase in HbA1c predicted\nby the SLC5A2 gene is associated with a decrease in eGFR.\nConversion to mimic pharmacological\ninhibition, that is,\nlowering genetically predicted HbA1c per 1-SD unit by SGLT2\ninhibition, reduces the risk of eGFR decline, which means that\nSGLT2 inhibitors are demonstrated to have a nephroprotective\neffect. All of the above P-values were less than 0.083 (Bonferroni-\ncorrected signiﬁcance level), suggesting statistical signiﬁcance and\nrobust results.\n3.3 Validation and sensitivity analysis\nFirst, as a sensitivity analysis, this study was validated using\nGWAS pooled data from another CKDGen meta-analysis, which\nyielded consistent ﬁndings across both multi-ancestry and\nEuropean populations (Table 2, Supplementary Figures 1, 2). The\nvalidation data indicated a negative correlation between HbA1c\npredicted by the gene SLC5A2 and eGFR. Speciﬁcally, for multi-\nancestry populations, IVW b was -0.027 (95% CI -0.046 to -0.007,\nP=0.007), and for populations of European ancestry, IVW b was\n-0.031 (95% CI -0.050 to -0.011, P=0.002). These results are\nconsistent with the primary study outcomes.\nSecondly, as shown in Table 2, MR analyses applying the\nweighted median method in the positive control, primary outcome,\nand validation outcome groups yielded consistent ﬁndings.\nThird, the IVW heterogeneity test using the Cochran Q test in\neach group separately showed that neither the Q statistic nor the P\nvalue was signiﬁcant (P > 0.05), implying that there was no evidence\nof heterogeneity in the effect of SGLT2 inhibition on eGFR. The test\nof pleiotropy using the MR-Egger intercept term showed that the P-\nvalue for the intercept was greater than 0.05, which implies that\nhorizontal pleiotropy was not shown (Table 2).\nFourth, as shown in Supplementary Figures 3-6, the leave-one-\nout analysis in the primary outcome data and validation data for\nFrontiers in Endocrinology\n05\nfrontiersin.org"},{"page":6,"text":"Liu\n10.3389/fendo.2024.1418575\nFIGURE 2\nMR forest plot of the effect of SLC5A2 on eGFR in multi-ancestry\npopulations. eGFR, estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate; IVW,\nInverse Variance Weighted; MR, Mendelian randomization.\nFIGURE 3\nMR forest plot of the effect of SLC5A2 on eGFR in European\npopulations. eGFR, estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate; IVW,\nInverse Variance Weighted; MR, Mendelian randomization.\nboth multi-ancestry and European populations indicated that the\neffect sizes remained on the same side of the reference line 0,\ndemonstrating robust results. This analysis conﬁrms the negative\ncorrelation between the SLC5A2 gene and eGFR.\nOverall, the results of the MR analysis in this study were robust.\n4 Discussion\nIn this study, we performed MR analysis of drug targets and\ndetermined the genetic causal effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on eGFR.\nThis ﬁnding provides genetic validation of the mechanism of action\nof SGLT2 inhibitors in improving renal function and delaying\nCKD progression.\nSeveral large clinical observational or randomized controlled\nstudies have found that canagliﬂozin, dapagliﬂozin, and\nempagliﬂozin produce a sustained improvement in kidney disease\nprognosis, including slowing eGFR decline, reducing albuminuria,\nand lowering the risk of renal failure (1, 13, 26, 27). This\nimprovement is not only seen in T2DM patients, but patients\nwithout diabetes can also beneﬁt. Based on extensive evidence of\nSGLT2 inhibitors in patients with CKD, KDIGO updated its clinical\npractice guideline in 2022 to recommend SGLT2 inhibitors as\npreferred therapeutic agents for managing T2DM combined with\nCKD (2). SGLT2 inhibitors are crucial for managing T2DM\ncombined with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).\nThey are the ﬁrst-line therapeutic agents for patients with T2DM\ncombined with ASCVD, cardiovascular risk factors, heart failure\n(HF), and CKD. Additionally, SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended\nfor treating patients with HF or CKD who do not have comorbid\ndiabetes (28).\nIt is worth noting that the currently completed randomized\ncontrolled trials of various SGLT2 inhibitors have different\nrequirements for minimum eGFR levels in the enrollment criteria.\nMoreover, there are differences in the design of clinical studies for\ndifferent SGLT2 inhibitors, and the respective protocols may be\nheterogeneous, so the ﬁndings of clinical studies corresponding to\none drug may not be directly generalizable to other drugs of the same\nclass. Randomized controlled trials are generally costly and lengthy.\nIn contrast, a new research approach in recent years, drug-targeted\nMR, has signiﬁcant advantages. MR is a method that utilizes genetic\nvariants closely associated with exposure as a potentially\nunconfounded tool to infer a causal relationship between exposure\nand outcome. New approaches, such as genetic co-localization and\ngenetic variation (eQTL) associated with drug target mRNA\nexpression, can be used to create MR instrumental variables for use\nin drug targets (14), which has become a new research hotspot.\nPrevious MR studies have further explored the beneﬁts of\nSGLT2 inhibitors. Xu M et al. (15) investigated the role of SGLT2\ninhibition in reducing coronary artery disease (CAD) and T2DM.\nThey found that SGLT2 inhibition lowered the risk of both\nconditions, with choline metabolites partly mediating these\neffects. Another study focused on HF and identiﬁed that SGLT2\ninhibition reduced HF risk through anti-inﬂammatory\nmechanisms, speciﬁcally via the CXCL10 biomarker (29). These\nstudies support our ﬁndings and highlight the broader therapeutic\npotential of SGLT2 inhibitors in managing complex diseases like\nCKD, T2DM, CAD, and HF.\nTo the best of our knowledge, few relevant MR studies have\nexplored the genetic causal effect of SGLT2 inhibition on the effects\nof eGFR.

Our MR analysis\nrevealed that genetically predicted SGLT2 inhibition resulted in a\nreduced risk of eGFR decline. This result supports the association\nbetween IR and renal function found in previous observational\nstudies, using genetic data to provide further causal evidence. The\nEMPA-KIDNEY trial (27), the most extensive international\nmulticenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical\ntrial in CKD to date, conﬁrmed that empagliﬂozin treatment\nsigniﬁcantly reduced the risk of the primary endpoint event,\nwhich includes kidney disease progression and cardiovascular\ndeath, compared to placebo. An updated subgroup analysis of the\nEMPA-KIDNEY study conﬁrmed that Engeletin signiﬁcantly slows\nthe progression of chronic kidney function in a broad population of\nCKD patients regardless of CKD etiology, diabetes status, eGFR and\nurinary ACR levels (31, 32). Our ﬁndings provide timely and robust\nevidence for the role of SGLT2 inhibition in reducing CKD risk.\nThe potential mechanisms linking SLC5A2 inhibition and\neGFR may involve reduced expression of SLC5A2, inhibition of\nSGLT2 receptors, leading to decreased reabsorption of glucose and\nsodium in renal tubules, which results in osmotic diuresis and lower\nblood pressure (1). Additionally, these inhibitors may exert anti-\ninﬂammatory effects, alleviate renal oxidative stress, and modulate\nmetabolic pathways, collectively supporting renal function (3, 4).\nHowever, there are some limitations to this study. First, this\nstudy could only predict the effect of drugs on eGFR by interfering\nwith the encoded proteins (targeting effect). We cannot rule out the\npossibility that drugs alter eGFR risk through other proteins (off-\ntarget effects). Second, our MR analyses estimated SGLT2 inhibition\nbased on targeted reductions in genetically predicted HbA1c levels\nrather than direct effects of SGLT2 inhibitors. This is based on the\nassumption that the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on HbA1c levels is\nproportional to their overall effect, which may be inconsistent with\nthe actual mechanism of SGLT2 inhibitors. In addition, the drug\nformulation, dosage, and mode of administration of SGLT2\ninhibitors can inﬂuence their effects on eGFR. These factors\nshould be taken into account when interpreting our ﬁndings.\nThird, genetic variation reﬂects the effect of lifelong exposure to a\nbiomarker on outcome and therefore cannot be used to directly\nestimate the expected impact of short-term pharmacologic changes\nin that biomarker (33). This means that the effect sizes in our study\nmay not be comparable to those reported in trials or observational\nstudies. Fourth, although the MR-Egger method is dependent on\nthe orientations of SNPs and can inﬂuence the outcome of the\nanalysis, our study conducted a pleiotropy test using the MR-Egger\nintercept term, which showed no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy\n(P > 0.05). Finally, our analyses were conducted mainly in European\npopulations. Therefore, this limits the generalizability of our\nﬁndings to other ethnicities. The potential for confounding\nfactors in observational data must also be considered, as they\nmight affect the accuracy and applicability of the results.\nFuture studies should explore the genetic causal effect of SGLT2\ninhibition on eGFR in diverse populations to enhance the\ngeneralizability of the ﬁndings. Additionally, future research should\naim to integrate genetic evidence with experimental and clinical\nstudies to provide a comprehensive understanding of how SGLT2\ninhibitors can be leveraged to protect against CKD progression.\n5 Conclusions\nOur results show that SLC5A2 is negatively correlated with\neGFR, identifying a causal role of SGLT2 inhibition with eGFR. By\nmodeling the drug-targeted effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, it was thus\nconcluded that inhibition of SLC5A2 gene expression was causally\nassociated with higher eGFR. The renoprotective effect of SGLT2\ninhibitors was validated from the perspective of genetic variation,\nand also provided MR evidence for SGLT2 inhibitors as ﬁrst-line\ntherapeutic agents for CKD patients.\nData availability statement\nThe datasets presented in this study can be found in online\nrepositories.
