This study employs Mendelian Randomization (MR) to assess the causal relationship between SGLT2 inhibitors and these lower limb safety outcomes. association with complications, limb Methods: A two-sample drug-target MR approach was used, complemented by a one-sample MR and genetic association analysis. Six SNPs were selected as instrumental variables to proxy the effect of SGLT2 inhibition. Primary outcomes were major limb safety outcomes, including osteomyelitis, lower limb ulcers, PAD, and cellulitis. The primary analytical method was the generalized inverse variance-weighted (IVW) approach, along with several sensitivity analyses. Results: The MR analysis indicated no signiﬁcant causal association between genetically proxied SGLT2 inhibition and most of the studied lower limb safety outcomes. However, a signiﬁcant association with PAD was observed, necessitating careful interpretation due to discrepancies between IVW and MR-Egger results. Sensitivity analyses supported these ﬁndings, showing little evidence of heterogeneity or directional pleiotropy. Conclusion: This study suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors may not be signiﬁcantly associated with an increased risk of most lower limb safety outcomes, including osteomyelitis, in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, the complex relationship with PAD highlights the need for further research. These ﬁndings contribute to the understanding of the safety proﬁle of SGLT2 inhibitors, supporting their continued use in diabetes management while underlining the importance of continuous safety monitoring. lower limb ulcers, and cellulitis, KEYWORDS SGLT2 inhibition, osteomyelitis, peripheral artery disease, ulcers, cellulitis, mendelian randomization Frontiers in Pharmacology 01 frontiersin.org Chen et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1401103 Introduction Furthermore, Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including medications like canagliﬂozin, dapagliﬂozin, and empagliﬂozin, have gained widespread approval","chunk_id":"Chen et al. - 2024 - Impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on lower limb complications a mendelian randomization perspective_0","doi":"Chen et al. - 2024 - Impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on lower limb complications a mendelian randomization perspective"},{"text":"the safety proﬁle of SGLT2 inhibitors, supporting their continued use in diabetes management while underlining the importance of continuous safety monitoring. lower limb ulcers, and cellulitis, KEYWORDS SGLT2 inhibition, osteomyelitis, peripheral artery disease, ulcers, cellulitis, mendelian randomization Frontiers in Pharmacology 01 frontiersin.org Chen et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1401103 Introduction Furthermore, Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including medications like canagliﬂozin, dapagliﬂozin, and empagliﬂozin, have gained widespread approval as antihyperglycemic drugs. They are known for their effectiveness in reducing blood sugar levels and decreasing the risk of cardiovascular issues in diabetic patients (Scheen, 2020; Xu B. et al., 2022). While these medications offer signiﬁcant advantages, in 2017, the FDA announcement highlighted an increased risk of lower limb amputations, particularly with canagliﬂozin usage (UFaD; Chang et al., 2018; Neal et al., 2017; Lee, 2017). Despite the removal of this warning in 2020 after further evaluation of its beneﬁts, the continued mention of amputation risks associated with SGLT2 inhibitors in the warnings and precautions section of their prescribing information emphasizes persistent concerns. involving lower lesser-explored complications, limb ulcers, osteomyelitis, and other related infections pose a rapidly increasing threat, especially for patients with type 2 diabetes, potentially heightening the risk of amputation (Chang et al., 2018; Neal et al., 2017; Nani et al., 2023; Custodio et al., 2020; Dicembrini et al., 2019). Current research shows mixed results, complicating our understanding of these negative outcomes. One retrospective cohort study highlighted an increased risk of osteomyelitis, peripheral artery disease (PAD), and ulcers (Chang et al., 2018). On the other hand, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving type 2 diabetes patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors found a generally neutral impact on osteomyelitis and PAD, but a link to local ulcers was noted (Nani et al., 2023). The repercussions of these adverse effects go beyond the immediate health issues, inﬂuencing patient quality of life, clinical decision-making, and public health strategies. Considering the complexities and potential biases in observational studies, our research employs Mendelian Randomization (MR) as a reliable method to explore the cause-and-effect relationship between SGLT2 inhibitors and lower limb safety outcomes (Dai et al., 2023). MR uses speciﬁc genetic variants linked to SGLT2 inhibitors as instrumental random assignment of individuals to varying exposure levels, akin to a RCT (Sekula et al., 2016). This methodology increases the accuracy of our results by reducing confounding factors and pleiotropy, thus providing a more nuanced understanding of the safety proﬁle of SGLT2 inhibitors, particularly regarding lower limb complications in type 2 diabetes patients (Burgess et al., 2023). simulation of variables, enabling a With the rising incidence of diabetes and the escalating use of SGLT2 inhibitors in its management, thoroughly investigating potential risks to lower limbs is essential for responsible and informed medical care (Khouri et al., 2018).

Our study, based on MR, seeks to clarify the intricate link between SGLT2 inhibitors and lower limb safety outcomes, focusing on the genetic factors that contribute to these worrying complications. Materials and methods Study design Figure 1 illustrates the comprehensive design of our study. Our goal was to evaluate the potential causal effects of SGLT2 inhibition on osteomyelitis and other critical limb safety issues using a dual- method approach: a two-sample drug-target MR combined with a one-sample MR. First, the SNPs, selected based on their association strength and relevance, act as proxies for SGLT2 inhibition for the next step. We then focused on outcomes such as osteomyelitis, as well as other signiﬁcant limb safety outcomes like lower limb ulcers, PAD, and cellulitis. The primary method of analysis was the inverse variance-weighted (IVW) method, which was reinforced by various sensitivity analyses, including MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode approaches, to verify the strength of our results. Following this, we performed a one-sample MR analysis within the UK Biobank for these outcomes. This step was intended to support and authenticate the initial ﬁndings from the two-sample MR approach. Genetic associations with SGLT2 inhibition four-stage instrument selection process, To develop genetic instruments that act as surrogates for the long-term glucose-lowering effects of SGLT2 inhibition, we implemented a as previously described (Dai et al., 2023; Xu M. et al., 2022). Initially, we identiﬁed genetic variants associated with the mRNA expression of the SLC5A2 gene, leveraging data from the Genotype- Tissue Expression (GTEx) project (Consortium, 2020) and the eQTLGen Consortium (Vosa et al., 2021). This step focused on identifying potential functional genes of SGLT2 inhibitors (refer to Supplementary Table S1). Next, the connection between each SLC5A2 variant and HbA1c levels was assessed, which was indicative of the glucose-reducing impact of SGLT2 inhibition. Variants with a region-wide link to HbA1c were selected based on data from a subset of UK Biobank participants of European descent without diabetes (association p-value = 1 × 10−4) (see Supplementary Table S1) (Elsworth et al., 2020). The third phase involved validating whether SLC5A2 and HbA1c shared a common causal variant through genetic colocalization analysis. This method, likelihood that a bivariate Bayesian model, in circulation were SLC5A2 expression and HbA1c inﬂuenced by the same causal variant within the SLC5A2 region (Walker et al., 2020). Lastly, a standard clumping process was executed (applying a correlation threshold <0.8 to exclude highly correlated variants). The efﬁcacy of the genetic variants as predictors was then evaluated using F statistics, focusing on their statistical power for each exposure tested. Following these rigorous steps, six genetic variants strongly linked to SGLT2 inhibition through HbA1c were selected as genetic instruments for the MR analysis (refer to Supplementary Table S2). estimated the levels Study outcomes The main focus of our study was on signiﬁcant limb safety outcomes.

The research involved two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to explore the impact of SGLT2 inhibition on lower limb safety outcomes. The ﬁgure at the top was employed to illustrate the theoretical associations among genetic variants (SNPs), SGLT2 inhibitors (exposure), and lower limb safety outcomes. This graphical depiction accounts for the potential inﬂuence of unobserved confounding variables. In this diagram, solid arrows denote permissible relationships between these variables, reﬂecting known or hypothesized causal connections. Conversely, dashed lines are utilized to indicate relationships that are proscribed. These prohibited connections are crucial for selected SNPs to meet the criteria for their validity as an instrumental variable. The ﬁgure at the bottom shows six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), serving as instrumental variables, which were carefully chosen as proxies for the effect of SGLT2 inhibition. Lower limb safety outcomes, encompassing osteomyelitis, lower limb ulcers, peripheral artery disease and cellulitis were identiﬁed as the targeted outcomes. Summary data for both exposure and outcomes were sourced from pertinent meta- analyses of genomewide association analyses. The primary method for estimating the causal effect on selected outcomes was the generalized inverse variance-weighted approach. The study incorporated several sensitivity analyses.

Validation of MR assumptions and sensitivity analyses Statistical analysis MR analyses of SGLT2 inhibition and limb safety outcomes We gathered and analyzed summary data of six instrumental SNPs’ genetic associations from GWAS relevant to our study. To align the effects of an SNP on both the exposure and the outcome, harmonization procedures were put into place before carrying out causal estimations. We employed the IVW method (Burgess et al., 2017) to bolster the analysis power. This method accounted for the correlation among the six genetic predictors of SGLT2 inhibition, allowing for a more lenient clumping threshold.

Sensitivity analyses Additional sensitivity analyses, including MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode and weighted mode analyses (Supplementary Table S3), consistently provided little evidence supporting an association between genetically proxied SGLT2 inhibition and the mentioned outcomes. Notably, for PAD, MR-Egger analysis showed a different direction of association compared to the IVW approach. addressing concerns the studies and the FDA’s Our study used MR to investigate the causal relationship between SGLT2 inhibitors and lower limb safety outcomes, speciﬁcally raised previous by observational safety communication regarding the use of SGLT2 inhibitors. The key ﬁndings suggest that while there is no signiﬁcant association with most lower limb complications such as osteomyelitis, ulcers, and cellulitis, the connection with PAD observed requires cautious interpretation. The discrepancy between the IVW and MR-Egger results suggests that this association may be inﬂuenced by pleiotropic effects, which could direct SGLT2 inhibition. through mechanisms operate other than The global recognition of gliﬂozins’ beneﬁts in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and their cardio- and nephroprotective advantages in broader patient populations is well-established (Margonato et al., 2021; Granata et al., 2022). These drugs have been shown to decrease glycated hemoglobin, enhance major Frontiers in Pharmacology 04 frontiersin.org Chen et al. 10.3389/fphar.2024.1401103 metabolic parameters, and signiﬁcantly reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (Teo et al., 2021). However, alongside these beneﬁts, it is crucial to continuously evaluate their safety proﬁle, especially considering concerns about adverse lower limb events. Our MR ﬁndings contribute to the ongoing discussion about the safety of SGLT2 inhibitors, particularly in the context of lower limb complications such as amputations. Previous literature, including RCTs and observational studies, has produced mixed results regarding the association between SGLT2 inhibitors and lower limb adverse events (Lindbom et al., 1988). A cohort study involving commercially insured patients, reﬂective of real-world scenarios, demonstrated that users of SGLT-2 inhibitors exhibited higher rates of PAD, osteomyelitis, and lower limb ulcers when compared to individuals using metformin, sulfonylureas, such associations were not observed when compared to new users of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (Chang et al., 2018). In contrast, comprehensive meta-analysis of 42 RCTs with 29,491 patients on SGLT2 inhibitors and 23,052 in control groups revealed no signiﬁcant association with osteomyelitis and PAD, but a heightened risk of ulcers (Nani et al., 2023). This highlights the need for personalized medical approaches that consider individual risk factors and comorbid conditions when prescribing these medications. thiazolidinediones.

Patients with this condition inherently face and infections, which can lead to more severe complications such as amputations (Armstrong et al., 2017; Jeffcoate and Harding, 2003). For outcomes like PAD and ulcer of lower limb, our MR study suggests a more complex relationship than what has been reported in some RCTs and observational studies (Brownrigg et al., 2013). Genetic variants mimicking SGLT2 inhibition represent lifelong effects, yet they may not reﬂect the short-term clinical impacts or the gradual development of conditions like PAD and lower limb ulcers. The inconsistent result between MR-Egger and IVW for PAD may arise due to the limited number of included SNPs, potentially leading to less accurate estimates in the MR, which performs best with a larger number of genetic variants (Bowden et al., 2015). Another explanation for this is possible unaddressed pleiotropy or instrumental variables. Despite no signiﬁcant biases heterogeneity or pleiotropy affecting our instrumental variables as indicated by the tests, for a cautious approach to clinical application. Future research endeavors should consider reﬁning genetic instruments, exploring broader datasets, and extending follow-up durations to provide a more between nuanced SGLT2 inhibition and PAD. these ﬁndings call understanding relationship in our the of It suggests Regarding osteomyelitis, the evidence from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database introduces an intriguing that exposure to perspective (Zhao et al., 2023). SGLT2 inhibitors, particularly canagliﬂozin, may be a primary cause of osteomyelitis in diabetic patients. However, the lack of association with other widely used SGLT2 inhibitors, such as dapagliﬂozin and empagliﬂozin, emphasizes the need for a granular examination of individual drugs within the SGLT2 inhibitor class (Mascolo et al., 2022). This study, when compared with observational studies, illuminates the methodological strengths of MR analysis. Genetic variants that mimic SGLT2 inhibition reﬂect the lifelong effects of these inhibitors on the expression levels of SLC5A2. However, the magnitude of these effects may not accurately represent the short-term impacts of SGLT2 inhibitors (Klen and Dolzan, 2021). Therefore, MR analysis is more valuable for determining the direction of potential causal effects rather than for quantifying their magnitude. Meanwhile, we used the largest data on osteomyelitis currently available and employed various sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our ﬁndings. While observational studies may be susceptible to potential confounders and draw relative risks, the MR study, leveraging genetic variants as instrumental variables, is less likely to be affected by confounders. This allows for a more direct evaluation of the causal effect of SGLT2 inhibition on adverse outcomes in the lower extremities, enhancing the reliability of our ﬁndings. evidence standardized deﬁnitions Several limitations should be acknowledged in interpreting our study ﬁndings.

This assumption hinges on the idea that the effect of SGLT2 inhibition on HbA1c levels proportionally represents its overall impact, which may not entirely align with the actual mechanism of SGLT2 inhibition. Additionally, the deﬁnitions used for outcomes, particularly ulcer of lower limb, may exhibit variations across different datasets and studies. The absence of introduces variability, potentially affecting result comparability. Moreover, our research did not extend to evaluating the risk of lower limb complications associated with SGLT2 inhibitors in non-diabetic populations, such as individuals with heart failure or chronic kidney disease who do not exhibit diabetic symptoms.

This study aimed to investigate the causal relationship between antidiabetic medications and gastrointestinal disorders, with the goal of reducing the incidence of diabetes-related gastrointestinal diseases and exploring the potential repurposing of antidiabetic drugs. Methods We employed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) design to investigate the causal association between antidiabetic medications and gastrointestinal disorders, including gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), gastric ulcer (GU), chronic gastritis, acute gastritis, Helicobacter pylori infection, gastric cancer (GC), functional dyspepsia (FD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn’s disease (CD), diverticulosis, and colorectal cancer (CRC). To identify potential inhibitors of antidiabetic drug targets, we collected single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with metformin, GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, insulin, and its analogs, thiazolidinediones, sulfonylureas, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors from published genome-wide association study statistics. We then conducted a drug-target Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using inverse variance weighting (IVW) as the primary analytical method to assess the impact of these inhibitors on gastrointestinal disorders. Additionally, diabetes was selected as a positive control. Results Sulfonylureas were found to significantly reduce the risk of CD (IVW: OR [95% CI] = 0.986 [0.978, 0.995], p = 1.99 × 10− 3), GERD (IVW: OR [95% CI] = 0.649 [0.452, 0.932], p = 1.90 × 10− 2), and chronic gastritis (IVW: OR [95% CI] = 0.991 [0.982, 0.999], p = 4.50 × 10− 2). However, they were associated with an increased risk of GU development (IVW: OR [95%CI] = 2 0.761 [1.259, 6.057], p = 1 0.12 × 10− 2). Conclusions The results indicated that sulfonylureas had a positive effect on the prevention of CD, GERD, and chronic gastritis but a negative effect on the development of gastric ulcers. However, our research found no causal evidence for the impact of metformin, GLP-1 agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, DPP 4 inhibitors, insulin and its analogs, thiazolidinediones, or alpha-glucosidase inhibitors on gastrointestinal diseases. *Correspondence: Fanjie Liu liufj198211@126.com Ying Yin 563298098@qq.com Full list of author information is available at the end of the article © The Author(s) 2024.

Graphical abstract Page 2 of 10 Keywords Antidiabetic drugs, Diabetes, Gastrointestinal diseases, Drug targets, Mendelian randomization study Background According to the United European Gastroenterology, the incidence of gastrointestinal diseases is increasing each year [1]. Studies on the demography of aging in the elderly and the epidemiology of gastrointestinal diseases show a strong association between age and a higher prevalence of these disorders. As the population ages, the prevalence of gastrointestinal diseases is expected to rise [2]. Many factors contribute to the development of gastrointestinal disorders, and research by Babu Krishnan et al. indicates that diabetes can lead to a variety of gastrointestinal com- plications [3]. A prospective study demonstrated a higher prevalence of GERD symptoms among patients with type 2 diabetes compared to the general population [4]. Additionally, a systematic review of meta-analyses found that diabetes significantly increases the risk of inflamma- tory bowel disease [5]. Retrospective studies have also shown a correlation between autoimmune gastritis and type 1 diabetes [6]. Furthermore, patients with diabe- tes are more susceptible to Helicobacter pylori infection [7, 8]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies conducted by Jinru Guo et al. demonstrated that the risk of gastric cancer is higher in individuals with dia- betes, with the risk varying based on the duration since the onset of diabetes [9]. Chin-Hsiao Tseng’s population- based analysis in Taiwan similarly suggests that people with diabetes have a higher risk of developing stomach cancer [10, 11]. Moreover, patients with diabetes have a significantly higher risk of death from colon cancer [12]. A Mendelian Randomization (MR) study suggests that type 2 diabetes and impaired glycemic homeostasis raise the risk of gastrointestinal diseases [13]. Antidia- betic drugs may also be linked to gastrointestinal dis- eases. Animal experiments by Isabela R.S.G Noleto et al. showed that metformin has a protective effect on the gastric mucosa and prevents peptic ulcer formation in hyperglycemic rats [14]. Furthermore, metformin pos- sesses anti-inflammatory properties and is used to treat inflammatory bowel disease [15]. Metformin may reduce the risk of inflammatory bowel disease in people with type 2 diabetes [16]. It also reduces the risk of inflamma- tory bowel diverticulosis in patients with type 2 diabetes Page 3 of 10 [17]. Retrospective cohort studies have found that met- formin reduces the risk of gastric and colorectal cancer in patients with diabetes [18–20]. Additionally, studies have shown that metformin reduces the risk of Helicobacter Pylori (HP) infection [21], and insulin use is signifi- cantly associated with a higher incidence of HP eradica-","chunk_id":"Ju et al. - 2024 - The causal relationship between anti-diabetic drugs and gastrointestinal disorders a drug-targeted_1","doi":"Ju et al. - 2024 - The causal relationship between anti-diabetic drugs and gastrointestinal disorders a drug-targeted"},{"text":"tory bowel diverticulosis in patients with type 2 diabetes Page 3 of 10 [17]. Retrospective cohort studies have found that met- formin reduces the risk of gastric and colorectal cancer in patients with diabetes [18–20]. Additionally, studies have shown that metformin reduces the risk of Helicobacter Pylori (HP) infection [21], and insulin use is signifi- cantly associated with a higher incidence of HP eradica- tion [22]. Audrius Dulskas et al. found an increased risk of stomach cancer in patients with diabetes treated with sulfonylureas [23]. However, a retrospective population- based cohort study conducted on the Italian population revealed a reduction in GC risk associated with sulfonyl- urea usage [24]. Observational studies on the relationship between dif- ferent antidiabetic drugs and gastrointestinal disorders have produced controversial results. No studies have yet explored the causal relationship between antidiabetic drugs and gastrointestinal disorders. MR is an analyti- cal method used to study causal relationships between exposures and clinically relevant outcomes [25]. It can predict adverse drug reactions and provide opportunities for drug repurposing [26]. MR of drug targets can reflect the effects of drug use by using genetic instrumentation within or near the target gene to analyze genetic variants that mimic the pharmacological inhibition of drug tar- gets [27]. between antidiabetic drugs and gastrointestinal diseases including GERD, GU, chronic gastritis, acute gastritis, Helicobacter pylori infection, gastric cancer, FD, IBS, UC, CD, diverticulosis, and CRC. The results can guide medication choices for patients with diabetes with gas- trointestinal complications and suggest potential gastro- intestinal prevention strategies for future clinical trials. This can improve the happiness index and quality of life for patients with diabetes, especially elderly people. Methods Research design We estimated the causal relationship between anti- diabetic drugs and gastrointestinal diseases by a TSMR study (Fig. 1). We selected the major antidiabetic drugs, including metformin, GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, insulin and its analogs, thiazolidinediones, sulfonylureas, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors [28, 29]. Genetic variants associated with blood glucose levels in these drug-target genes were identified to proxy the drug-target effect [27]. We then analyzed the effect of these genetic variants on gastrointestinal disor- ders using MR. Data source In this study, we used SNPs in or near target as phar- macogenetic proxies to explore the causal relationship Aggregate data for all genome-wide association studies (GWAS) used in the study were obtained from the IEU Fig. 1 This is a flowchart of the study design and the MR Analysis process The causal relationship between antidiabetic drugs and gastrointestinal disorders was assessed by a two-sample MR analysis dealing with exposure and outcome data. Three core assumptions were met: (1) IVs and exposure (antidiabetic drugs) are strongly correlated; (2) there is no correlation between IVs and confounders; and (3) there is no direct correlation between IVs and outcomes, and their effect on outcomes can only be reflected by the degree of exposure Page 4 of 10 400,458 Dataset 4,218,897 European Population Sample size Number of SNPs ebi-a-GCST90025986 Table 1 Summary of the GWAS included in this MR study Trait Exposure Blood glucose Outcome GERD gastric ulcer Chronic","chunk_id":"Ju et al. - 2024 - The causal relationship between anti-diabetic drugs and gastrointestinal disorders a drug-targeted_2","doi":"Ju et al. - 2024 - The causal relationship between anti-diabetic drugs and gastrointestinal disorders a drug-targeted"},{"text":"between IVs and confounders; and (3) there is no direct correlation between IVs and outcomes, and their effect on outcomes can only be reflected by the degree of exposure Page 4 of 10 400,458 Dataset 4,218,897 European Population Sample size Number of SNPs ebi-a-GCST90025986 Table 1 Summary of the GWAS included in this MR study Trait Exposure Blood glucose Outcome GERD gastric ulcer Chronic gastritis Acute gastritis Helicobacter pylori GC FD IBS UC CD Diverticulosis CRC Positive control outcomes Diabetes GERD: Gastroesophageal reflux disease; GU: Stomach ulcers; GC: Gastric cancer; FD: functional dyspepsia; IBS: Irritable bowel syndrome; UC: Ulcerative colitis; CD: Crohn’s Disease; CRC: Colorectal cancer; MR: Mendelian randomization; GWAS: Genome-wide association studies; SNPs: Single nucleotide polymorphisms ebi-a-GCST90000514 ebi-a-GCST90018851 ukb-b-6716 finn-b-K11_ACUTGASTR ukb-b-531 ebi-a-GCST90018849 finn-b-K11_FUNCDYSP ukb-b-2592 ukb-b-7584 ukb-a-552 finn-b-K11_DIVERTIC ieu-b-4965 2,320,781 24,178,780 9,851,867 16,380,389 9,851,867 24,188,662 16,380,380 9,851,867 9,851,867 10,894,596 16,380,412 11,738,639 European European European European European European European European European European European European 602,604 474,278 463,010 NA 462,933 476,116 189,695 462,933 462,933 337,199 182,423 377,673 ukb-b-12,948 European 9,851,867 462,933 Table 2 Target genes of antidiabetic drugs from DrugBank and ChEMBL databases Drug class Metformin GLP-1 receptor agonists SGLT2 inhibitors DDP-4 inhibitors Insulin and its analogues Thiazolidinediones Sulfonylureas Encoding genes of target proteins ChEMBL DrugBank Fifty-eight encoding genes PRKAB1 GPD2 ETFDH GLP1R GLP1R SLC5A2 SLC5A2 DPP4 DPP4 INSR INSR PPARG PPARG KCNJ11 KCNJ11 ABCC8 ABCC8 M6PR M6PR Gene location (NA) Chr6: 39,016,557 − 39,059,079 Chr16: 31,494,323 − 31,502,181 Chr2: 162,848,755 −162,930,904 Chr19: 7,112,266-7,294,425 Chr3: 12,328,867 − 12,475,855 Chr11: 17,386,719 − 17,410,878 Chr11: 17,414,045 − 17,498,441 Chr17:78,075,380− 78,093,680 Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors GLP-1: glucagon-like peptide-1; SGLT2: sodium-glucose cotransporter-2; DPP4: dipeptidyl peptidase-4; NA: not applicable Open GWAS database (https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/datas- ets) [30] and are detailed in Table 1. control [36], utilizing GWAS pooled data that included 462,933 samples. Genetic instrumentation for antidiabetic drugs Statistical analysis We used the DrugBank (go.drugbank.com) and ChEMBL (ebi.ac.uk/chembl) databases to identify genes encoding the target proteins of these antidiabetic drugs [31, 32] (Table 2). Based on previous studies [33], we selected genome-wide salient variants (p < 5 × 10− 8) associated with blood glucose levels and SNPs within a 100 kb win- dow of the target gene for each drug to determine expo- sure to antidiabetic drugs [34]. The instrumental variant SNPs were located within ± 100 kb of the antidiabetic drug site, ensuring that the linkage imbalance was not too strong (r2 < 0.3). We estimated the F-statistic of the instrument, retaining only SNPs with an F > 10 to avoid weak instrument bias [35]Since antidiabetic drugs are used to treat diabetes, we used diabetes as a positive We used MR analysis to align drug-targeted instrumen- tal variables with outcome datasets. The inverse variance weighting (IVW) method was employed as the primary analytical method, disregarding the intercept term and using the reciprocal of the outcome variance (se squared) as a fitting weight [37].

The weighted median, MR-Egger regression, simple mode, and weighted mode were used as supplementary analysis methods to further improve the credibility and accuracy of the results [38]. To avoid heterogeneity in instrumental variables (IVs), we used Cochran’s Q test, where p > 0.05 indicated no significant heterogeneity [39]. The IVW method requires care- ful consideration of IVs to ensure their non-pleiotropic nature, as biased results may arise otherwise. Pleiotropy was assessed using MR-Egger regression to ensure that IVs did not introduce bias through alternative pathways. MR-Egger regression incorporates an intercept term and uses the inverse of the outcome variance (se squared) as a weighting factor for fitting. If the MR-Egger intercept is close to 0 or p > 0.05, it indicates no evidence of pleiotro- pic effects in IVs [40]. The “leave-one-out” method was used to systematically eliminate each SNP, calculate the meta-effect of the remaining SNPs, and assess whether there were any alterations in the results upon removal of each individual SNP. This approach aimed to mitigate potential influences from specific SNPs on our findings [41]. All analyses were performed using the “Two Sample MR” package [42] in R version 4.3.1. The threshold of sta- tistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results Selection and validation of genetic instruments A total of 400,458 samples were included in the aggre- gated data of blood glucose GWAS. Through a rigorous selection process, no suitable genetic instruments were found for drugs such as metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, DDP-4 inhibitors, Insulin and its analogs, Thiazolidin- ediones, Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, etc. However, two SNPs were identified for GLP-1 receptor agonists, with one having an F-value of 11.5 after excluding those with F < 10. For sulfonylureas, three SNPs were identified with F-values of 11.4, 14.4, and 36.6, respectively. The F-values of these SNPs are all above the threshold of 10, indicating that our study largely avoids weak instrument bias. Positive control analysis The pharmacogenetic analysis of antidiabetic drugs and diabetes mellitus showed positive results for sulfonyl- ureas (IVW: OR [95% CI] = 1.12 [1.07–1.17], p = 1.97E- 07). In contrast, the analysis for GLP-1 receptor agonists was negative (IVW: OR [95% CI] = 0.99 [0.93–1.06], p = 0.78) (Fig. 2). These positive control analyses validated the genetic instruments for sulfonylureas but not for GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Thus, our MR analysis proved to be reliable and robust. Discussion We conducted large-scale MR analyses on gastrointesti- nal diseases using data from the IEU Open GWAS data- base. Our study investigated the causal relationship of seven common antidiabetic drug targets–metformin, GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, DPP-4 inhib- itors, insulin and its analogs, thiazolidinediones, sulfo- nylureas and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors–on various gastrointestinal diseases. These diseases included GERD, GU, chronic gastritis, acute gastritis, Helicobacter pylori infection, gastric cancer, FD, IBS, UC, CD, diverticulosis, and CRC. Our MR results showed that SGLT2 inhibitors, DDP-4 inhibitors, Insulin and its analogs, Thiazolidinedi- one, and other drugs did not have significant effects on gastrointestinal diseases and were not further analyzed. GLP-1 receptor agonists did not affect gastrointestinal Fig. 2 Relationship between GLP-1 receptor agonists, sulfonylureas and diabetes mellitus nsnp (number of single nucleotide polymorphisms), OR (odds ratio), CI (confidence interval) Page 6 of 10 Fig. 3 The relationship between GLP-1 receptor agonists and gastrointestinal disorders nsnp (number of single nucleotide polymorphisms), OR (odds ratio), CI (confidence interval), GERD: Gastroesophageal reflux disease;; GC: Gastric cancer; functional dyspepsia (FD); IBS: Irritable bowel syndrome; UC: Ulcerative colitis; CD: Crohn’s Disease; CRC: Colorectal cancer tract diseases. Notably, sulfonylureas were found to reduce the risk of CD, GERD, and chronic gastritis but increase the risk of developing stomach ulcers. The mechanisms underlying the preventive effects of sulfonylureas on the development of CD, GERD, chronic gastritis, and increased risk of GU remain unexplored. However, examining the pathways through which diabe- tes causes gastrointestinal diseases and reviewing clinical studies on sulfonylureas provide some insights. Previous retrospective studies have indicated that gas- trointestinal disorders are common complications of dia- betes [43, 44]. MR studies have demonstrated an elevated risk of GERD [45] and gastritis [13] in individuals with diabetes. An MR study conducted by Xiang Xiao et al. revealed that type 2 diabetes reduces the risk of inflam- matory bowel disease [46]. The pathogenesis of gastro- intestinal complications in diabetes has been extensively explored in numerous articles. Studies have shown that people with diabetes are more likely to develop GERD [45]. Animal studies have","chunk_id":"Ju et al. - 2024 - The causal relationship between anti-diabetic drugs and gastrointestinal disorders a drug-targeted_5","doi":"Ju et al. - 2024 - The causal relationship between anti-diabetic drugs and gastrointestinal disorders a drug-targeted"},{"text":"GERD [45] and gastritis [13] in individuals with diabetes. An MR study conducted by Xiang Xiao et al. revealed that type 2 diabetes reduces the risk of inflam- matory bowel disease [46]. The pathogenesis of gastro- intestinal complications in diabetes has been extensively explored in numerous articles. Studies have shown that people with diabetes are more likely to develop GERD [45]. Animal studies have iden- tified glucose-responsive neurons in the central nervous system, suggesting that high blood glucose may alter vagal efferent activity [47]. Clinical studies have shown that diabetes mellitus leads to dysfunction of the para- sympathetic component of the autonomic nervous sys- tem, resulting in esophageal innervation dysfunction and gastroesophageal reflux disease [48, 49]. Sulfonylureas can reduce the incidence of GERD by modulating Drp- 1-mediated oxidative stress and apoptosis, which ame- liorates peripheral neuropathy [50, 51]. Crohn’s disease is a recurrent systemic inflammatory disease primarily involving the gastrointestinal tract, with extraintestinal manifestations and associated immune disorders [52, 53]. Studies have shown that mast cells release biologically active mediators such as serine proteases mMCP-6 and Prss31, which are involved in the development of acute colitis [54]. Animal experiments by Vijay Chidrawar et al. have shown that sulfonylureas can ameliorate inflamma- tion by blocking cystic fibrosis transmembrane conduc- tance modulator channels on mast cells [55]. Chronic gastritis is an inflammatory disease of the gastric mucosa [56]. P Kashyap et al. demonstrated that oxidative stress plays a crucial role in diabetes mellitus, triggering gas- trointestinal complications [39]. Oxidative stress results from an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and endogenous antioxidant defense mechanisms [40]. Experiments in diabetic rats showed that sulfonylureas have significant antioxidant effects and can be used to treat Crohn’s disease and chronic gastri- tis by attenuating oxidative stress-induced damage. In addition, abnormal NLRP3 inflammasome activity has been identified as a key factor in the pathogenesis of Crohn’s disease and chronic gastritis [57, 58]. Inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome by sulfonylureas can effectively inhibit the release of major proinflammatory cytokines/ chemokines, which can effectively treat Crohn’s disease and chronic gastritis [58, 59]. The main factors leading to gastric ulcers include the presence of strong acids and high levels of proteolytic activity (pepsin) in gastric secretions [60]. Control tests by H.A.F Ismail et al. demonstrated that nicorandil could provide gastric protection by opening K (ATP) channels, scavenging free radicals, reducing pepsin and gastric acid secretion, and preventing harmful elevation of nitric oxide during water immersion-restraint stress [61]. How- ever, sulfonylureas reduce blood glucose by inhibiting Page 7 of 10 Fig. 4 The relationship between Sulfonylureas and gastrointestinal disorders nsnp (number of single nucleotide polymorphisms), OR (odds ratio), CI (confidence interval), GERD: Gastroesophageal reflux disease; GC: Gastric cancer; functional dyspepsia (FD); IBS: Irritable bowel syndrome; UC: Ulcerative colitis; CD: Crohn’s Disease; CRC: Colorectal cancer potassium flux in the ATP-dependent potassium chan- nel (KATP) and inducing glucose-independent insulin release from β-cells [62]. As K (ATP) channel blockers [63], sulfonylureas can negate the protective effects of opening these channels, thereby increasing the risk of stomach ulcers. Furthermore, a comparative study showed that hypo- glycemia is","chunk_id":"Ju et al. - 2024 - The causal relationship between anti-diabetic drugs and gastrointestinal disorders a drug-targeted_6","doi":"Ju et al. - 2024 - The causal relationship between anti-diabetic drugs and gastrointestinal disorders a drug-targeted"},{"text":"dyspepsia (FD); IBS: Irritable bowel syndrome; UC: Ulcerative colitis; CD: Crohn’s Disease; CRC: Colorectal cancer potassium flux in the ATP-dependent potassium chan- nel (KATP) and inducing glucose-independent insulin release from β-cells [62]. As K (ATP) channel blockers [63], sulfonylureas can negate the protective effects of opening these channels, thereby increasing the risk of stomach ulcers. Furthermore, a comparative study showed that hypo- glycemia is associated with increased total pepsin secre- tion [64]. Sulfonylureas stimulate insulin release from pancreatic cells and have an extrapancreatic hypoglyce- mic effect, making them more likely to induce hypogly- cemia [65]. The most common side effect of sulfonylureas is hypoglycemia [66]. Hence, one of the mechanisms by which sulfonylureas increase the risk of gastric ulcer may be attributed to their side effect of causing hypoglycemia, which subsequently leads to increased pepsin secretion and eventually gastric ulcer. We employed MR studies to establish causal associa- tions between sulfonylureas and CD, GERD, chronic gas- tritis, and GU. (1) Our MR study utilized genetic variants as proxies for antidiabetic drugs to mitigate confound- ing factors and reverse causality issues that may have affected previous studies. (2) Our analysis focused on individuals of European ancestry for both exposure and individual outcome data in order to effectively minimize potential association effects arising from population stratification. (3) In our study design, we selected genetic variants within a 100 kb window of the coding gene using a threshold of 5 × 10− 8 as instrumental variables. Addi- tionally, we filtered out instrumental variables with an F value of less than 10 to improve the reliability of our results. (4) To ensure the robustness of our findings, we conducted positive control analysis, heterogeneity tests, pleiotropy tests, and sensitivity analyses throughout our study process. These measures further enhance the reli- ability of our results. However, it is important to acknowledge certain limi- tations in our study. Firstly, the TSMR analysis was solely based on individuals of European ancestry, which restricts generalizability beyond this specific population group. Caution should be exercised when extrapolating these findings to racially and ethnically diverse popula- tions. Secondly, drug target MR can assess long-term drug effects but cannot replace clinical trials for verifying short-term drug effects. MR provides a way to analyze the causal relationship between exposure and outcome but cannot replace clinical trials. Also, our study did not investigate the association between other antidia- betic drugs and gastrointestinal diseases. Lastly, we used GWAS summary data from the IEU Open GWAS data- base. The data sources were not stratified, so further stratified analysis could not be performed. Page 8 of 10 Conclusions This study provides evidence that sulfonylureas may pre- vent CD, GERD, and chronic gastritis while increasing the risk of GU. These findings could help diabetic patients in managing and preventing certain gastrointestinal dis- eases. Further clinical trials are necessary to elucidate the potential mechanistic pathways between sulfonylureas and these conditions.

For further validation in terms of genetic variation, drug-targeted Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to investigate the causal role of SGLT2 inhibition on eGFR effects. Methods: Genetic variants representing SGLT2 inhibition were selected as instrumental variables. Drug target Mendelian randomization analysis was used to investigate the relationship between SGLT2 inhibitors and eGFR. The IVW method was used as the primary analysis method. As a sensitivity analysis, GWAS pooled data from another CKDGen consortium was used to validate the ﬁndings. Results: MR results showed that hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, regulated by the SLC5A2 gene, were negatively correlated with eGFR (IVW b -0.038, 95% CI -0.061 to -0.015, P = 0.001 for multi-ancestry populations; IVW b -0.053, 95% CI -0.077 to -0.028, P = 2.45E-05 for populations of European ancestry). This suggests that a 1- SD increase in HbA1c levels, regulated by the SLC5A2 gene, is associated with decreased eGFR. Mimicking pharmacological inhibition by lowering HbA1c per 1-SD unit through SGLT2 inhibition reduces the risk of eGFR decline, demonstrating a renoprotective effect of SGLT2 inhibitors. HbA1c, regulated by the SLC5A2 gene, was negatively correlated with eGFR in both validation datasets (IVW b -0.027, 95% CI -0.046 to -0.007, P=0.007 for multi-ancestry populations, and IVW b -0.031, 95% CI -0.050 to -0.011, P=0.002 for populations of European origin).

KEYWORDS sodium-glucose cotransporter protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibition, SLC5A2, eGFR, drug target Mendelian randomization, insulin resistance 1 Introduction Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a disease that seriously jeopardizes human health. In recent years, cardiorenal protection studies have made signiﬁcant progress in patients with CKD, and the introduction of sodium-glucose cotransporter protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in particular has provided an important new tool in the treatment of CKD (1, 2). These inhibitors target SGLT2, which is responsible for the reabsorption of glucose and sodium in the proximal tubules of the kidneys. SGLT2 inhibitors lower glucose levels and blood pressure by lowering the renal threshold for glucose excretion and by promoting negative salt and water homeostasis. They also have an effect on glomerular hemodynamics, leading to a decrease in glomerular ﬁltration rate, which is reversible when treatment is stopped. This phenomenon is known as “glomerular feedback”. In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), SGLT2 inhibitors affect glomerular ultraﬁltration by decreasing vascular resistance and inducing vasodilation. In addition, these inhibitors reduce ﬁbrosis in the proximal tubule by decreasing energy expenditure and inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (3). Another growing area of research is the ability of SGLT2 inhibitors to induce a fasting state (4). All of these effects reduce cellular stress and inﬂammation in cardiac and renal to be the pathophysiologic reason for the beneﬁcial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiac and renal function (1). tissues, which is thought SGLT2 inhibitors, including canagliﬂozin, dapagliﬂozin, and empagliﬂozin, are widely approved antihyperglycemic agents that improve insulin resistance (IR) (5), and are used to reduce glycemia and cardiovascular risk in T2DM patients (6). Large clinical trials provide compelling evidence to support their beneﬁcial effects on major adverse cardiovascular events, hospitalization for heart failure (7–11) and renal outcomes (12, 13). However, studies on genetic variants related to SGLT2 inhibitors’ renoprotective effects are limited. The SLC5A2 gene encodes SGLT2, crucial for renal glucose reabsorption. Despite promising results in clinical studies, challenges such as variable patient responses and long-term effects remain. Addressing these challenges is essential to optimize clinical application. In the ﬁeld of precision medicine, ﬁnding effective molecular targets is a key task. Traditional methods to study the mechanism of action of target proteins through pharmacology are inefﬁcient and time-consuming. The drug target Mendelian randomization (MR) has emerged as a novel and powerful research method. Novel methods such as gene co-localization and gene variants associated with drug target mRNA expression (expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)) can be used to create MR tool variables for drug exposure (14). The eQTL is a type of expressed quantitative trait locus, which can be classiﬁed into cis-eQTL and trans-eQTL by analyzing the relationship between the amount of gene expression and the locus. The former regulates genes that are closer together, while the latter regulates genes that are farther apart.

The former regulates genes that are closer together, while the latter regulates genes that are farther apart. Drug target MR utilizes genetic instrumental variables to explore the causal relationship between molecules and diseases. This approach is based on the downstream products of target proteins, using Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) near the coding genes of the target proteins that have signiﬁcant effects on these downstream products (protein Quantitative Trait Loci (pQTL) or eQTL) as the instrumental variables. The concentration of the downstream products of the target proteins serves as the exposure, while disease serves as the endpoint. MR is then performed to verify the effect of the target proteins on the studied diseases, providing new ideas for drug development and effect prediction. This strategy can be used to investigate the biological mechanism of the effect of SGLT2 inhibition on eGFR. Given that the genetic mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibition in CKD protection are poorly understood, we hypothesized that SGLT2 inhibitors may be causally related to eGFR. Therefore, our study was designed to assess the genetic causal effect of SGLT2 inhibition on eGFR. We performed a two-sample MR analysis using genetic variants associated with SLC5A2 gene expression and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels as instrumental variables. This helps to expand our understanding of the mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitors in renal protection and provides evidence for this. 2 Methods 2.1 Study design Figure 1 illustrates a schematic of the study design. The study was conducted in the following ﬁve steps: 1) Genetic variants representing the effects of SGLT2 inhibition were selected as instrumental variables. 2) Pooled GWAS data for T2DM was selected as a positive control. 3) The outcome factor, eGFR, was Frontiers in Endocrinology 02 frontiersin.org Liu 10.3389/fendo.2024.1418575 FIGURE 1 Drug-targeted MR study design.

Genetic variants representing SLC5A2 gene expression levels were selected by screening cis-eQTLs with a genotype frequency of less than 5×10^-8. These variants inﬂuence SLC5A2 gene expression at the RNA transcription level. The expression further affects protein levels, which in turn inﬂuence HbA1c levels. Thus, different expression levels of the SLC5A2 gene can mimic the therapeutic effects of SGLT2 inhibitors (glucose-lowering effects, reduced HbA1c). We studied the impact of these varying expression levels on eGFR. selected. 4) MR analyses were performed to estimate the causal effects of SGLT2 inhibition on eGFR. 2.2 Data sources 2.2.1 Selection of genetic variants of SGLT2 inhibitors The process of selecting genetic variants for SGLT2 inhibitors is described in detail in the study of Xu M. et al.

GWAS data for T2DM were obtained from the Diabetes Genetics Replication and Meta- analysis (DIAGRAM) consortium, and GWAS data for eGFR were obtained from the CKDGen consortium. 2.2.2.1 Positive control data Positive control MR analysis justiﬁes the genetic tool of a drug by demonstrating the expected effect on an outcome that has an established causal relationship with the target drug (19). SGLT2 inhibitors are used as a glucose-lowering drug with the intended indication of T2DM. Therefore, T2DM GWAS pooled data was selected as a positive control.

Also, this data has been integrated into the GWAS Catalog database (GCST90103633, GCST90103634) (Table 1). The GWAS summary statistics used in this study can be found in the IEU OpenGWAS project (https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/), the GTEx portal (https://www.gtexportal.org/), the eQTLGen consortium (https://eqtlgen.org/), the DIAGRAM consortium (https:// diagram-consortium.org/), CKDGen (https://ckdgen.imbi.uni- freiburg.de/), UKB Research (https://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank, ukb-d-30750_irnt), and the GWAS Catalog (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ gwas/downloads/summary-statistics, GCST008058, GCST008064, GCST90103633, GCST90103634). 2.3 Statistical analysis In the ﬁrst place, genetic variant screening for SGLT2 inhibitors applied a generalized inverse variance weighting (IVW) method to consider the correlation of six predictors. MR effects were estimated by the LD matrix and IVW and MR-Egger methods to improve the efﬁciency and stability of the analysis (24). Subsequently, in MR analysis, the IVW method was used as the primary method to explore the effect of SGLT2 inhibition on the positive control T2DM and the study outcome eGFR (19). Various methods (including MR-Egger, weighted median, simple, and weighted models) were applied to test the reliability and stability of the results. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology-Mendelian Randomization (STROBE-MR) guidelines were applied to guide the design of this study and the writing of the results (19). All statistical analyses were performed using the “Two-sample MR” (version 0.5.6) and “MR” (version 0.5.1) packages in the R software (version 4.3.2) environment. To more accurately interpret causality, we set the level of statistical signiﬁcance to the Bonferroni-corrected level, that is, P < 0.0083. All As a sensitivity analysis, we applied an independent validation with a separate dataset. The validation data came from GWAS pooled data from another CKDGen meta-analysis, details of which are shown in Table 1. To control for heterogeneity, we applied the MR multivalent residuals and outliers (MR-PRESSO) method. To test potential MR hypotheses, such as assessing the effect of directional pleiotropy, we applied the generalized MR-Egger regression method. Both tests of pleiotropy using the MR-Egger intercept term and tests of heterogeneity among predictors (Cochran Q statistic for IVW and global test for MR-PRESSO) were used to quantify the level of pleiotropy in the MR analysis. Compared to the MR-Egger, the MR- PRESSO method has higher accuracy for identifying levels of multivalence and outliers (25). The stability of outliers","chunk_id":"Liu - 2024 - Assessment of the effect of the SLC5A2 gene on eGFR a Mendelian randomization study of drug targets_4","doi":"Liu - 2024 - Assessment of the effect of the SLC5A2 gene on eGFR a Mendelian randomization study of drug targets"},{"text":"generalized MR-Egger regression method.

Compared to the MR-Egger, the MR- PRESSO method has higher accuracy for identifying levels of multivalence and outliers (25). The stability of outliers and results was also tested using the leave-one-out sensitivity analysis method, funnel plots, and scatter plots. For a more rigorous interpretation of causality, we also used the Bonferroni correction based on the number of SNPs analyzed in the ﬁnal MR. We used the signiﬁcance level after performing the Bonferroni correction, which was set at 0.0083 (0.05 divided by 6 SNPs), to control for the rate of false discovery of multiple comparisons. In each independent SNP analysis, we compared the P value to 0.0083 to determine whether statistical signiﬁcance existed. 3 Results 3.1 Effect of positive control-SLC5A2 on T2DM To conduct a positive control, T2DM GWAS data were selected as outcome data and analyzed using MR with SLC5A2. As shown in Table 2, the MR results indicated that a 1-SD increase in HbA1c regulated by SLC5A2 was associated with an 83% increase in the risk of T2DM (IVW OR 1.83, 95% CI: 1.180-2.846, p = 0.007). This result effectively mimics the pharmacological inhibition mechanism of SGLT2 inhibitors, demonstrating that SGLT2 inhibition reduces the risk of T2DM. SGLT2 inhibitors, as glucose-lowering drugs, have an established causal relationship with T2DM, and the results of the positive control analysis were consistent with the expected outcomes. This suggests that SGLT2 inhibition decreases the risk of T2DM and demonstrates that the target gene, SLC5A2, can serve as a genetic tool for the drug target of SGLT2 inhibitors. 3.2 Effect of SLC5A2 on eGFR The IVW method showed evidence to support a causal association between SLC5A2 and eGFR (Table 2, Figures 2, 3). As shown in Table 2, the MR results indicated that the SLC5A2 gene, was negatively correlated with eGFR (IVW b -0.038, 95% CI -0.061 to -0.015, P = 0.001 for multi-ancestry populations; IVW b -0.053, Frontiers in Endocrinology 04 frontiersin.org Liu 10.3389/fendo.2024.1418575 TABLE 2 MR estimation of the effect of SLC5A2 on T2DM and eGFR.

This suggests that each 1-SD increase in HbA1c predicted by the SLC5A2 gene is associated with a decrease in eGFR. Conversion to mimic pharmacological inhibition, that is, lowering genetically predicted HbA1c per 1-SD unit by SGLT2 inhibition, reduces the risk of eGFR decline, which means that SGLT2 inhibitors are demonstrated to have a nephroprotective effect. All of the above P-values were less than 0.083 (Bonferroni- corrected signiﬁcance level), suggesting statistical signiﬁcance and robust results. 3.3 Validation and sensitivity analysis First, as a sensitivity analysis, this study was validated using GWAS pooled data from another CKDGen meta-analysis, which yielded consistent ﬁndings across both multi-ancestry and European populations (Table 2, Supplementary Figures 1, 2). The validation data indicated a negative correlation between HbA1c predicted by the gene SLC5A2 and eGFR. Speciﬁcally, for multi- ancestry populations, IVW b was -0.027 (95% CI -0.046 to -0.007, P=0.007), and for populations of European ancestry, IVW b was -0.031 (95% CI -0.050 to -0.011, P=0.002). These results are consistent with the primary study outcomes. Secondly, as shown in Table 2, MR analyses applying the weighted median method in the positive control, primary outcome, and validation outcome groups yielded consistent ﬁndings. Third, the IVW heterogeneity test using the Cochran Q test in each group separately showed that neither the Q statistic nor the P value was signiﬁcant (P > 0.05), implying that there was no evidence of heterogeneity in the effect of SGLT2 inhibition on eGFR. The test of pleiotropy using the MR-Egger intercept term showed that the P- value for the intercept was greater than 0.05, which implies that horizontal pleiotropy was not shown (Table 2).

This analysis conﬁrms the negative correlation between the SLC5A2 gene and eGFR. Overall, the results of the MR analysis in this study were robust. 4 Discussion In this study, we performed MR analysis of drug targets and determined the genetic causal effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on eGFR. This ﬁnding provides genetic validation of the mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors in improving renal function and delaying CKD progression. Several large clinical observational or randomized controlled studies have found that canagliﬂozin, dapagliﬂozin, and empagliﬂozin produce a sustained improvement in kidney disease prognosis, including slowing eGFR decline, reducing albuminuria, and lowering the risk of renal failure (1, 13, 26, 27). This improvement is not only seen in T2DM patients, but patients without diabetes can also beneﬁt. Based on extensive evidence of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with CKD, KDIGO updated its clinical practice guideline in 2022 to recommend SGLT2 inhibitors as preferred therapeutic agents for managing T2DM combined with CKD (2). SGLT2 inhibitors are crucial for managing T2DM combined with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). They are the ﬁrst-line therapeutic agents for patients with T2DM combined with ASCVD, cardiovascular risk factors, heart failure (HF), and CKD. Additionally, SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for treating patients with HF or CKD who do not have comorbid diabetes (28). It is worth noting that the currently completed randomized controlled trials of various SGLT2 inhibitors have different requirements for minimum eGFR levels in the enrollment criteria. Moreover, there are differences in the design of clinical studies for different SGLT2 inhibitors, and the respective protocols may be heterogeneous, so the ﬁndings of clinical studies corresponding to one drug may not be directly generalizable to other drugs of the same class. Randomized controlled trials are generally costly and lengthy. In contrast, a new research approach in recent years, drug-targeted MR, has signiﬁcant advantages. MR is a method that utilizes genetic variants closely associated with exposure as a potentially unconfounded tool to infer a causal relationship between exposure and outcome. New approaches, such as genetic co-localization and genetic variation (eQTL) associated with drug target mRNA expression, can be used to create MR instrumental variables for use in drug targets (14), which has become a new research hotspot. Previous MR studies have further explored the beneﬁts of SGLT2 inhibitors. Xu M et al. (15) investigated the role of SGLT2 inhibition in reducing coronary artery disease (CAD) and T2DM. They found that SGLT2 inhibition lowered the risk of both conditions, with choline metabolites partly mediating these effects. Another study focused on HF and identiﬁed that SGLT2 inhibition reduced HF risk through anti-inﬂammatory mechanisms, speciﬁcally via the CXCL10 biomarker (29). These studies support our ﬁndings and highlight the broader therapeutic potential of SGLT2 inhibitors in managing","chunk_id":"Liu - 2024 - Assessment of the effect of the SLC5A2 gene on eGFR a Mendelian randomization study of drug targets_7","doi":"Liu - 2024 - Assessment of the effect of the SLC5A2 gene on eGFR a Mendelian randomization study of drug targets"},{"text":"in reducing coronary artery disease (CAD) and T2DM.

These studies support our ﬁndings and highlight the broader therapeutic potential of SGLT2 inhibitors in managing complex diseases like CKD, T2DM, CAD, and HF. To the best of our knowledge, few relevant MR studies have explored the genetic causal effect of SGLT2 inhibition on the effects of eGFR. A recently published study by Wang Z et al. investigated the role of circulating metabolites in the renoprotective effects of Frontiers in Endocrinology 06 frontiersin.org Liu 10.3389/fendo.2024.1418575 SGLT2 inhibition, speciﬁcally identifying small high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles as mediators in this process (30). However, our study differs in that it focuses on the direct genetic causal effect of SGLT2 inhibition on eGFR using MR analysis without considering metabolic intermediates. Our MR analysis revealed that genetically predicted SGLT2 inhibition resulted in a reduced risk of eGFR decline. This result supports the association between IR and renal function found in previous observational studies, using genetic data to provide further causal evidence. The EMPA-KIDNEY trial (27), the most extensive international multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in CKD to date, conﬁrmed that empagliﬂozin treatment signiﬁcantly reduced the risk of the primary endpoint event, which includes kidney disease progression and cardiovascular death, compared to placebo. An updated subgroup analysis of the EMPA-KIDNEY study conﬁrmed that Engeletin signiﬁcantly slows the progression of chronic kidney function in a broad population of CKD patients regardless of CKD etiology, diabetes status, eGFR and urinary ACR levels (31, 32). Our ﬁndings provide timely and robust evidence for the role of SGLT2 inhibition in reducing CKD risk. The potential mechanisms linking SLC5A2 inhibition and eGFR may involve reduced expression of SLC5A2, inhibition of SGLT2 receptors, leading to decreased reabsorption of glucose and sodium in renal tubules, which results in osmotic diuresis and lower blood pressure (1). Additionally, these inhibitors may exert anti- inﬂammatory effects, alleviate renal oxidative stress, and modulate metabolic pathways, collectively supporting renal function (3, 4). However, there are some limitations to this study. First, this study could only predict the effect of drugs on eGFR by interfering with the encoded proteins (targeting effect). We cannot rule out the possibility that drugs alter eGFR risk through other proteins (off- target effects). Second, our MR analyses estimated SGLT2 inhibition based on targeted reductions in genetically predicted HbA1c levels rather than direct effects of SGLT2 inhibitors. This is based on the assumption that the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on HbA1c levels is proportional to their overall effect, which may be inconsistent with the actual mechanism of SGLT2 inhibitors. In addition, the drug formulation, dosage, and mode of administration of SGLT2 inhibitors can inﬂuence their effects on eGFR. These factors should be taken into account when interpreting our ﬁndings. Third, genetic variation reﬂects the effect of lifelong exposure to a biomarker on outcome and therefore cannot be used","chunk_id":"Liu - 2024 - Assessment of the effect of the SLC5A2 gene on eGFR a Mendelian randomization study of drug targets_8","doi":"Liu - 2024 - Assessment of the effect of the SLC5A2 gene on eGFR a Mendelian randomization study of drug targets"},{"text":"to their overall effect, which may be inconsistent with the actual mechanism of SGLT2 inhibitors.

Third, genetic variation reﬂects the effect of lifelong exposure to a biomarker on outcome and therefore cannot be used to directly estimate the expected impact of short-term pharmacologic changes in that biomarker (33). This means that the effect sizes in our study may not be comparable to those reported in trials or observational studies. Fourth, although the MR-Egger method is dependent on the orientations of SNPs and can inﬂuence the outcome of the analysis, our study conducted a pleiotropy test using the MR-Egger intercept term, which showed no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy (P > 0.05). Finally, our analyses were conducted mainly in European populations. Therefore, this limits the generalizability of our ﬁndings to other ethnicities. The potential for confounding factors in observational data must also be considered, as they might affect the accuracy and applicability of the results. Future studies should explore the genetic causal effect of SGLT2 inhibition on eGFR in diverse populations to enhance the generalizability of the ﬁndings. Additionally, future research should aim to integrate genetic evidence with experimental and clinical studies to provide a comprehensive understanding of how SGLT2 inhibitors can be leveraged to protect against CKD progression. 5 Conclusions Our results show that SLC5A2 is negatively correlated with eGFR, identifying a causal role of SGLT2 inhibition with eGFR. By modeling the drug-targeted effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, it was thus concluded that inhibition of SLC5A2 gene expression was causally associated with higher eGFR. The renoprotective effect of SGLT2 inhibitors was validated from the perspective of genetic variation, and also provided MR evidence for SGLT2 inhibitors as ﬁrst-line therapeutic agents for CKD patients.
