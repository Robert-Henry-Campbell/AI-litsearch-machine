However, the function of mTORC1 downstream proteins, such as RPS6K, EIF4EBP, EIF-4E, EIF-4G, and EIF4A, in PD development remains unclear. Methods: We performed a Mendelian randomization study to evaluate the causal relationship between mTORC1 downstream proteins and Parkinson’s disease. We utilized various MR methods, including inverse-variance- weighted, weighted median, MR–Egger, MR-PRESSO, and MR-RAPS, and conducted sensitivity analyses to identify potential pleiotropy and heterogeneity. Results: The genetic proxy EIF4EBP was found to be inversely related to PD risk (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.67–0.92, p = 0.003), with the results from WM, MR-PRESSO, and MR-RAPS being consistent. The plasma protein levels of EIF4G were also observed to show a suggestive protective effect on PD (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.75–0.97, p = 0.014). No clear causal effect was found for the genetically predicted RP-S6K, EIF-4E, and EIF-4A on PD risk. Sensitivity analyses showed no signiﬁcant imbalanced pleiotropy or heterogeneity, indicating that the MR estimates were robust and independent. Conclusion: Our unbiased MR study highlights the protective role of serum EIF4EBP levels in PD, suggesting that the pharmacological activation of EIF4EBP activity could be a promising treatment option for PD.

Introduction The prevalence of Parkinson’s disease (PD), an age-related neurodegenerative con- dition, is increasing at a staggering rate [1]. In addition to decreased dopamine levels, it is typiﬁed by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which leads to symptoms such as tremors, muscle stiffness, and bradykinesia. The accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn), the major component of Lewy inclusion, has also emerged as a prominent neuropathological presentation of PD [2,3]. Unfortunately, there is currently no cure for PD. The current treatment strategies focus on managing symptoms and preventing neuronal death, making the identiﬁcation of new therapeutic targets for PD an urgent priority. Understanding the exact causes and mechanisms of the disease will aid in this effort. There is growing evidence that mTOR plays a key role in modulating the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of neurons [4].

There is growing evidence that mTOR plays a key role in modulating the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of neurons [4]. The mTOR protein kinase is widely present in all types of mammalian cells and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including protein synthesis, establishment of the cytoskeleton structure, metabolic regulation, cell growth, and survival [5,6]. mTOR exists in two distinct complexes: mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). mTORC1 is more responsive to rapamycin, the primary inhibitor of mTOR, than mTORC2 [7]. Various stimuli, such as alterations in the levels of insulin, energy, and amino acids, are perceived by mTORC1, which is frequently involved in protein synthesis, cell growth, cell proliferation, and autophagy. mTORC2, on the other hand, plays a role in cytoskeletal rearrangements [8,9]. Major targets Brain Sci. 2023, 13, 536. https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci13040536 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/brainsci Brain Sci. 2023, 13, 536 2 of 11 of mTORC1 include ribosomal protein S6K kinase 1 (RPS6K) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding proteins (EIF4EBPs). Both of them are the main regulators of cap-dependent protein synthesis and exert their effects on the regulation of protein translation by modulat- ing transcript initiation and elongation as well as ribosome biosynthesis [5,10]. Meanwhile, the eIF4F complex (eIF4E, eIF4G, and eIF4A) is essential for cap-dependent protein trans- lation, which is a rate-limiting step in protein synthesis. RPS6K is a positive regulator of eIF4F, while EIF4EBP tightly binds to eIF4E and negatively modulates eIF4F complex activity. Once EIF4EBP is phosphorylated by mTORC1, the dissociation of eIF4E–EIF4EBP initiates 5(cid:48) cap-dependent mRNA translation [11–13]. mTOR is thought to be involved in neurodegenerative disorders through its effects on autophagy and protein synthesis. In such disorders, an abnormal mTOR signaling cascade can disrupt autophagy ﬂux, leading to the accumulation of protein aggregates and hampering neuron survival [14]. As a critical regulator involved in cell metabolism and survival, mTOR has been considered a promising target against Parkinson’s disease. However, the role of mTOR in PD seems to be controversial, as both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects have been observed in different PD models. The neuroprotective effects induced by mTOR activation seem to contradict the beneﬁts of inhibiting mTOR in PD [15]. Therefore, we urgently want to know whether there is a causal relationship between mTORC1 downstream proteins and Parkinson’s disease, and whether this causality is protective or pathogenic. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis is a novel epidemiological method that uses summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to infer causality between exposures and certain diseases and identify potential risk factors. By using genetic variants as instrumental variables for exposures, MR can overcome the confounding factors that are often present in observational studies [16,17]. In this study, we used two-sample MR based on GWAS summary statistics of mTORC1-associated proteins in the European population to investigate the causal association of mTORC1-associated proteins (RPS6K, EIF4EBP, EIF-4E, EIF-4G, and EIF4A) with PD. 2.

Materials and Methods 2.1. Data Sources for Exposure The genetic variation of mTORC1-related proteins was extracted from the publicly available Human Plasma Proteome Atlas. The atlas includes data on 3622 plasma proteins obtained from 3301 healthy participants undergoing genetic control from the INTERVAL study [18]. These data link genetic factors to phenotypes based on protein information, providing a basis for potential targets for certain diseases. The INTERVAL study enrolled approximately 50,000 participants who were 18 years and older and excluded those with major diseases. The recruitment took place at 25 centers of England’s National Health Service Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) from mid-2012 to mid-2014. Blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes after standard venipuncture, and the isolated plasma was stored at −80 ◦C for research use [19]. The relative concentrations of 3622 plasma proteins were measured using the SOMAscan assay method, which can simultaneously measure extracellular and intracellular proteins as well as expand the lower limit of detection for protein abundance [20]. After a natural log transformation and adjustment for age, sex, and duration between the blood draw and linear regression processing, the protein concentrations could be determined [18]. 2.2. Data Sources for the Outcome The summary statistics for genetic studies on PD were gathered by the International Parkinson’s Disease Genomics Consortium. The data include 33,674 individuals diagnosed with PD and 449,056 controls from European ancestry samples. The analysis was a ﬁxed- effects meta-analysis across 17 datasets that all underwent a similar process of quality control for inclusion [21]. Brain Sci. 2023, 13, 536 3 of 11 2.3. Instrumental Variable We established inclusion criteria for selecting instrumental variables in order to obtain a precise assessment. These criteria include a signiﬁcance threshold of p < 5 × 10−6 and a linkage disequilibrium (LD) r2 < 0.05. Additionally, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with palindromic sequences were removed from the analysis. The acquired instru- mental variables were evaluated to ensure that they met the fundamental assumptions of a Mendelian randomization analysis (Figure 1): (1) they had to be signiﬁcantly associ- ated with the exposure of interest; (2) they must not have any relationship with potential confounders, and (3) the association between the instrumental variables and PD must be mediated by the exposure. We also utilized PhenoScanner to verify if any potential confounders were linked to the chosen instrumental variables by the SNPs. Ultimately, we identiﬁed reliable instrumental variables as proxies for the following proteins: RPS6K (16 SNPs), EIF4EBP (6 SNPs), EIF4E (13 SNPs), EIF4A (10 SNPs), and EIF4G (7 SNPs). Figure 1.

The IVW results were used as primary information, and a meta-analysis was performed to aggregate the Wald estimates of single SNPs in order to obtain overall estimates of mTORC1-related proteins on PD, respectively. These unbiased results were based on the assumption that there was no horizontal pleiotropy [22]. MR–Egger [23] and weighted median [24] analyses were used as supplemental evidence for the IVW results as they provide more robust estimates under a broad range of scenarios, despite lower efﬁciency. The MR-RAPS method can weigh the instrumental variables based on their Brain Sci. 2023, 13, 536 4 of 11 strength, which improves the efﬁciency of MR estimates in the presence of weak instrumen- tal variables while also balancing pleiotropy [25]. Additionally, sensitivity analyses were conducted to detect potential pleiotropy and heterogeneity. Heterogeneity was reported via Cochran’s Q test (p < 0.05). The intercept of MR–Egger regression provided evidence to evaluate horizontal pleiotropy (p < 0.05) [26]. MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) identiﬁed biased variants if they existed and removed them progressively to reduce any sign of horizontal pleiotropy [27]. Finally, the leave-one-out method was used to test whether any individual SNP confounded the effect estimates, for more robust conclusions. All the statistical analyses were carried out using the TwoSampleMR (version 0.5.6) and MR-PRESSO (version 1.0) packages in R (version 4.2.1). The p-value threshold for Bonferroni correction was set at 0.01 (0.05/5) to adjust for multiple testing. Results with a signiﬁcance level of less than 0.01 were considered strong evidence of a causal relationship, while those with a signiﬁcance level between 0.01 and 0.05 were considered indicative evidence of a relationship. 3. Results As seen in Figure 2, the levels of the genetic proxy EIF4EBP were found to have an inverse association with the risk of PD (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.67–0.92, p = 0.003). The results obtained from WM, MR-PRESSO, and MR-RAPS were consistent, which added conﬁdence to the conclusion that this association is likely causal. Additionally, indicative evidence was found for a potential causal effect of EIF4G levels on the risk of PD, whereby higher levels reduced the risk (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.75–0.97, p = 0.014). Similar causal estimates were also obtained using MR-PRESSO (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.82–0.89, p = 0.012) and MR-RAPS (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.80–0.91, p = 0.012). The detailed instrumental variables in the analysis were listed (Table S1). The impact of individual variables of EIF4EBP and EIF4G on PD was further demonstrated through the scatterplot and forest plot presented in Figure 3. However, the analysis of the effects of RPS6K, EIF4A, and EIF4E levels on the risk of PD did not reach statistical signiﬁcance.

Further- more, the MR–Egger regression intercept showed no evidence of unbalanced pleiotropy (all p > 0.05) (Table 1). The global test of MR-PRESSO also did not identify any pleiotropic bias. In addition, the absence of any signiﬁcant SNPs in the leave-one-out sensitivity analysis (Figure 4) suggests that no individual SNP could disrupt the causal relationship. Table 1.

Discussion As far as we know, this study is the initial investigation into the causal connection between the levels of mTORC1-dependent proteins (including RPS6K, EIF4EBP, EIF-4E, EIF-4A, and EIF-4G) and PD using MR methods and eliminating potential confounding factors through genetic variations. Utilizing data from the INTERVAL study on human plasma protein arrays and GWAS summary statistics from the International Parkinson’s Disease Genomics Consortium (IPDGC), we conducted a two-sample MR analysis. The MR study indicated a negative correlation between the levels of the EIF4EBP protein in the plasma (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.67–0.92, p = 0.003) and PD risk. We also discovered suggestive evidence of a protective effect of the plasma protein levels of EIF4G on PD (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.75–0.97, p = 0.014), despite the p-value not being signiﬁcant after Bonferroni correction. However, no clear evidence was found","chunk_id":"Tan et al. - 2023 - mTORC1-Dependent Protein and Parkinson's Disease A Mendelian Randomization Study_4","doi":"Tan et al. - 2023 - mTORC1-Dependent Protein and Parkinson's Disease A Mendelian Randomization Study"},{"text":"levels of the EIF4EBP protein in the plasma (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.67–0.92, p = 0.003) and PD risk.

However, no clear evidence was found to support a causal effect of the gene-predicted RP-S6K, EIF-4E, and EIF-4A on PD risk. Sensitivity analyses also did not reveal any signiﬁcant imbalanced pleiotropy or heterogeneity, indicating that the MR estimates were independent and robust. The mechanism by which mTOR regulates the survival of dopamine-producing neu- rons is still largely unknown. The inhibition of mTORC1 with rapamycin has been shown to decrease the levels of PARK7/DJ1, a protein linked to neurodegeneration that has beneﬁ- cial molecular chaperone and antioxidant properties and whose translation depends on mTORC1. Loss-of-function mutations in PARK7 are associated with early-onset, recessive forms of Parkinson’s disease [28]. The mTOR signaling pathway is essential for regulating protein synthesis and cell survival; thus, it is important to keep it active for its protective role in neurons. However, the ﬁne-tuning of mTOR activation may be necessary during Parkinson’s disease. mTORC1 controls both protein synthesis through translation and pro- tein degradation through autophagy. It negatively regulates autophagy by phosphorylating Atg13 and ULK1/2, inhibiting the formation of autophagosomes [29,30]. Alpha-synuclein accumulation is a hallmark of Parkinson’s disease, and it is believed to play a key role in the death of dopamine-producing neurons. By inhibiting mTOR, rapamycin promotes autophagy, which is a process by which cells degrade and recycle waste proteins and damaged cellular components. By increasing autophagy, rapamycin may help to prevent the accumulation of toxic alphasynuclein and protect dopamine-producing neurons from death. This highlights the potential therapeutic value of mTOR inhibition for treating Parkinson’s disease [31]. In summary, excessive or inadequate mTOR activity can be lethal to neurons. EIF4EBP is a crucial component of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, and its activity is tightly regulated by the balance of its phosphorylation levels. When EIF4EBP is un- derphosphorylated, it binds strongly to eIF4E, thus inhibiting cap-dependent translation initiation. However, when excessive phosphorylation occurs, EIF4EBP is released from eIF4E, resulting in increased cap-dependent translation [32,33]. The postmortem analysis of the brains of PD patients suggests oxidative stress as a potential mechanism of neu- rodegeneration. This is indicated by a lack of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) and the inhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity in the substantia nigra, along with increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity [34]. It has been proven that EIF4EBP is crucial for survival during stressful conditions, including starvation and oxidative stress. Activated EIF4EBP induces a rapid halt in cap-dependent translation, promoting the upregulation of stress response factors, such as antioxidants and molecular chaperones [35–37]. CHCHD2 is a mitochondrial protein-encoding gene that controls oxidative phosphorylation by regu- lating Cyt c and crista integrity. Dominant mutations in this gene are the cause of late-onset PD [38]. In a limited case study, several exonic variants that may affect CHCHD2 protein levels or","chunk_id":"Tan et al. - 2023 - mTORC1-Dependent Protein and Parkinson's Disease A Mendelian Randomization Study_5","doi":"Tan et al. - 2023 - mTORC1-Dependent Protein and Parkinson's Disease A Mendelian Randomization Study"},{"text":"rapid halt in cap-dependent translation, promoting the upregulation of stress response factors, such as antioxidants and molecular chaperones [35–37].

Dominant mutations in this gene are the cause of late-onset PD [38]. In a limited case study, several exonic variants that may affect CHCHD2 protein levels or subcellular localization showed an association with Parkinson’s disease [39]. In Drosophila, the loss of CHCHD2 can lead to abnormalities in the mitochondrial matrix structure and impaired mitochondrial respiration, which exacerbates the sensitivity to oxidative stress, loss of dopaminergic neurons, and motor dysfunction associated with Parkinson’s disease. In addition to these PD pathological phenotypes, a compensatory Brain Sci. 2023, 13, 536 8 of 11 upregulation of 4E-BP was also observed. These PD-related phenotypes were alleviated by the overexpression of the translation inhibitor 4E-BP and the introduction of human CHCHD2. By introducing 4E-BP into dCHCHD2-/-Drosophila, the general expression of 4E-BP decreased the ATP decline in drosophila. The same outcome was achieved by admin- istering rapamycin, which activates 4E-BP by inhibiting the kinase target of rapamycin [40]. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a prominent feature of PD, and the beneﬁcial role of 4E-BP in mitochondria reverses PD pathological phenotypes. Additionally, mutations in PINK1 and parkin lead to autosomal recessive hereditary Parkinson’s disease. Drosophila with PINK1 and parkin mutations display dopaminergic neurodegeneration, motor defects, and mito- chondrial dysfunction. These mutations are associated with signiﬁcant reductions in the phosphorylated levels of EIF4EBP, with corresponding increases in the proportion of active nonphosphorylated EIF4EBP. The over-expression of EIF4EBP can suppress all pathological phenotypes, and the loss of EIF4EBP function signiﬁcantly reduces the survival ability of parkin and PINK1 mutants. In vivo, EIF4EBP can be activated by the TOR inhibitor rapamycin [41]. Moreover, LRRK2 homologous mutations in Drosophila can produce PD phenotypes similar to those caused by parkin/PINK1 mutations, the most common genetic cause of PD [42]. LRRK2 contains both an active GTPase and kinase domain, which can promote cap-dependent translation and exhibit strong genetic interactions with the core members and regulators of the cap-binding protein complex. Generally, disease-associated mutations in LRRK2 often increase its kinase activity, thereby enhancing its toxicity. To date, a large number of LRRK2 mutations have been identiﬁed, with the G2019S variant being the most common. This mutation leads to increased protein synthesis in neurons, exhibiting the age-related loss of dopaminergic neurons and motor dysfunction, which can be improved by blocking the synthesis with protein synthesis inhibitors [43,44]. LRRK2 acts as a protein translation regulator by phosphorylating the 4E-BP protein at the T37/T46 site both in vitro and in vivo. However, the control of translation initiation is closely related to stress and lifespan, and these phosphorylation events appear to have important effects on stress sensitivity and dopaminergic neuron survival in LRRK2 mutant Drosophila. On the one hand, the overexpression of eIF4E and dLRRK leads to age-related phenotypes in DA neurons, whose gene expression pattern is consistent with gene expression under oxidative stress and aging conditions. This strongly suggests that a chronic decline in 4E-BP","chunk_id":"Tan et al. - 2023 - mTORC1-Dependent Protein and Parkinson's Disease A Mendelian Randomization Study_6","doi":"Tan et al. - 2023 - mTORC1-Dependent Protein and Parkinson's Disease A Mendelian Randomization Study"},{"text":"stress and lifespan, and these phosphorylation events appear to have important effects on stress sensitivity and dopaminergic neuron survival in LRRK2 mutant Drosophila.

This strongly suggests that a chronic decline in 4E-BP activity promotes oxidative stress and subsequent aging in DA neurons. On the other hand, it has been observed that the overexpression of 4E-BP or a reduction in dLRRK levels can provide protection in Drosophila models of PINK1 and parkin pathology [41,44,45]. This suggests that regulating 4E-BP expression to suppress the accumulation of abnormal protein is beneﬁcial. In our study, we revealed an inverse association between the levels of the genetic proxy EIF4EBP and PD risk. This is consistent with the observed effects in experimental studies. The expression of speciﬁc target genes and protein levels in circulation can be mod- ulated, making them potential targets for preventing PD. Given the mounting evidence implicating the mTOR signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of PD, it is unclear whether there is a causal relationship between mTORC1-related proteins and PD. Using epidemio- logical research methods, we determined in this study that an increase in EIF4EBP protein levels can help prevent PD, as previously observed in experimental studies. The disclo- sure of this unbiased causal relationship will guide a direction for future PD prevention and provide a potential intervention target, while also requiring further basic research to uncover potential pathophysiological mechanisms. In conclusion, targeting the mTOR pathway pharmacologically has promising potential as a treatment for PD. Further work is needed to fully understand the nuanced regulation of mTOR and its complex cellular pathways. It is crucial to continue the development of mTOR signaling modulators that meet therapeutic goals, while mitigating the adverse effects of current mTOR regulators, to achieve the desired clinical outcomes without negative consequences. The pharmacologic activation of EIF4EBP activity may represent a viable treatment option for PD. Brain Sci. 2023, 13, 536 9 of 11 One advantage of this study is the use of MR design. As alleles are randomly assigned and ﬁxed at conception, it minimizes the potential for observed associations to be biased by reverse causation and confounding. Secondly, we employed various MR methods including IVW, MR–Egger, WM, and MR-RAPS to robustly estimate causal relationships. MR–Egger regression and MR-PRESSO were used to detect pleiotropy to ensure the robustness of the conclusions. Thirdly, we provided robust genetic instruments by using multiple SNPs as instrumental variables for mTORC1-related proteins. Fourthly, our analysis utilized a large sample size with no overlap between the exposure and outcome, thereby result- ing in high statistical power for most of the analyses. This study has several limitations.

Secondly, as the study used summary statistics data and not individual-level data, it was not possible to conduct a subgroup analysis. Thirdly, the genetic variants used in MR studies reﬂect lifetime exposure and speciﬁc causal associa- tions, whereas randomized controlled trials only report the effects of short-term exposure. Therefore, it is difﬁcult to determine the effects of short-term exposure to high levels of EIF4EBP proteins on PD risk and to understand the effectiveness of any interventions. 5. Conclusions This unbiased MR study highlights the protective role of serum EIF4EBP levels in PD. Further research is required regarding the study of EIF4EBP’s role. Nevertheless, this study’s ﬁndings lay the foundation for a more effective pharmacological target in preventing and treating PD.

Applying systems biology to identify new applications for current pharmaceuticals can decrease the duration, expenses, and likelihood of failure associated with the development of new drugs. Methods: We identify tendinopathy signature genes employing a transcriptomics database encompassing 154 clinical tendon samples. We then proposed a systems biology based drug prediction strategy that encompassed multiplex transcriptional drug prediction, systematic review assessment, deep learning based efficacy prediction and Mendelian randomization (MR). Finally, we evaluated the effects of drug target using gene knockout mice. Results: We demonstrate that sirolimus is a repurposable drug for tendinopathy, supported by: 1) Sirolimus achieves top ranking in drug-gene signature-based multiplex transcriptional drug efficacy prediction, 2) Consistent evidence from systematic review substantiates the efficacy of sirolimus in the management of ten- dinopathy, 3) Genetic prediction indicates that plasma proteins inhibited by mTOR (the target of sirolimus) are associated with increased tendinopathy risk. The effectiveness of sirolimus is further corroborated through in vivo testing utilizing tendon tissue–specific mTOR gene knockout mice. Integrative pathway enrichment analysis suggests that mTOR inhibition can regulate heterotopic ossification-related pathways to ameliorate clinical tendinopathy. Conclusions: Our study assimilates knowledge of system-level responses to identify potential drugs for tendin- opathy, and suggests sirolimus as a viable candidate. A systems biology approach could expedite the repurposing of drugs for human diseases that do not have well-defined targets. 1. Background Tendinopathy is a prevalent musculoskeletal condition, representing around 30 % of musculoskeletal appointments in general practice [1]. The rotator cuff is the area most prone to injury, with a prevalence rate as high as 5.5 % in the whole population [1]. Each year, more than 200, 000 surgical procedures are carried out in the United States to repair the rotator cuff in cases of severe rotator cuff tendinopathy (RCT).

Computers in Biology and Medicine 186 (2025) 109665 frequently encounter the peril of postoperative non-healing and re-tearing [4]. Over the years, corticosteroid injections have been the mainstay pharmacological treatment for tendinopathy. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of corticosteroid injections remains controversial [5]. In conclusion, there is an urgent need for effective pharmacological treatment for tendinopathy. The process of drug discovery is typically inefficient, marked by escalating expenses, lengthy duration, and a high percentage of wastage [6]. Drug repurposing is a strategy that involves using existing phar- maceuticals that have already been thoroughly investigated for their safety and pharmacokinetic characteristics to treat different medical conditions [7]. Sildenafil, initially an antihypertensive, was repurposed by Pfizer for erectile dysfunction. By 2012, it held a 47 % market share, with global sales of $2.05 billion [8]. The typical cost of introducing a repurposed medicine to the market is projected to be around US$300 million, while a novel chemical entity is anticipated to cost between US $2–3 billion [7]. However, even in the case of medications that already exist, the procedure of conducting experimental preclinical screening followed by human safety and efficacy studies is arduous and time-consuming. Hence, it is imperative to prioritize the candidate medications. Over the past few decades, there has been substantial advancement and extensive adoption of high-throughput technologies, leading to a dramatic surge in the volume of omics data. There is a wealth of publicly available research that extensively examines the relationship between genetic variation and the effectiveness of treatment. The intricacy of disease biology and the necessity for customized treatment can be addressed by a systematic approach that relies on high-throughput data to confront significant obstacles in drug repurposing. In this regard, the application of systems biology might accelerate the process of priori- tizing candidate drugs by utilizing various strategies to thoroughly examine and integrate the existing information on a specific drug [8]. The goal of systems biology is to understand physiology and disease from the levels of molecular pathways, regulatory networks, cells, tis- sues, organs, and ultimately the entire organism [9].","chunk_id":"Wang et al. - 2025 - Sirolimus as a repurposed drug for tendinopathy A systems biology approach combining computational_1","doi":"Wang et al. - 2025 - Sirolimus as a repurposed drug for tendinopathy A systems biology approach combining computational"},{"text":"repurposing. In this regard, the application of systems biology might accelerate the process of priori- tizing candidate drugs by utilizing various strategies to thoroughly examine and integrate the existing information on a specific drug [8]. The goal of systems biology is to understand physiology and disease from the levels of molecular pathways, regulatory networks, cells, tis- sues, organs, and ultimately the entire organism [9]. Drug repositioning based on systems biology can be defined as: in drug repositioning under specific drug conditions, the use of high-throughput genomic data from humans and various model organisms. These different types of data are integrated using systems biology approaches, including network-based and signature-based methods; the predicted outputs are validated in different model organisms [10]. This work presents a systems biology approach to identify prospec- tive treatment candidates for tendinopathy by 1) applying multiplex transcriptional drug prediction based on a clinical tendon tran- scriptomics database, 2) screening candidates through systematic re- view and evidence level assessment, 3) evaluating high-potential drugs through deep learning integrating drug structure information, and 4) exploring genetic evidence of drugs for tendinopathy treatment in Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. Finally, we validated thera- peutic potential of the sirolimus target against clinical tendinopathy based on animal models. 2. Methods 2.1. Key resources table used in the study.

In the in vivo drug experiment, 12 8-week-old rats (equal numbers of males and females) were induced with tendinopathy by injecting 30U Type I collagenase (Gibco, 17100017) into the midportion of the Achilles tendon of 8-week-old rats. The same procedure was repeated after 3 days to stabilize the effect. Divide the 12 rats into two groups, with each rat receiving four subcutaneous injections (between the Achilles tendon and the skin, every 3 days) one week after modeling: the control group (sterile PBS, 20 μL) and the sirolimus group (sirolimus, 70uM, 20 μL). Weekly assessments of motor function were conducted on the rats after modeling, followed by euthanasia for transcriptomic sequencing and histological evaluation. The effectiveness of sirolimus is further corroborated through in vivo testing utilizing tendon tissue–specific mTOR gene knockout mice. The tendinopathy was generated by injecting 12.5 U of type 1 collagenase (Gibco, 17100017) into the middle of the right Achilles tendons of 8- week-old mice. The same operation was performed 3 days later to sta- bilize the effect. At 6 weeks following modeling, 8 wild-type (WT) mice and 8 mTOR tendon knockout (mTOR-TKO) mice were euthanized. The legs were then excised for histopathology. 2.3. Method details 2.3.1. RNA sequence The tissue was subjected to RNA extraction using TRIzol® Reagent following the directions provided by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Subsequently, DNase I (TaKara) was used to eliminate genomic DNA. The RNA-seq transcriptome libraries were generated using the Tru- SeqTM RNA sample preparation Kit from Illumina (San Diego, CA). A total of 1 μg of RNA was used for this process. In brief, messenger RNA was extracted using polyA selection through oligo(dT) beads and sub- sequently fragmented using a fragmentation buffer. The process involved in this study included cDNA synthesis, end repair, A-base addition, and ligation of the Illumina-indexed adaptors, following the methodology provided by Illumina.

Following quantification using the TBS380, the paired-end libraries were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq with a run length of 2X150bp. 2.3.2. Reads quality control and mapping The unprocessed paired end readings underwent trimming and quality checking using Trimmomatic with the default parameters (htt p://www.usadellab.org/cms/uploads/supplementary/Trimmomatic). The clean reads were aligned to the reference genome using the hisat2 software in orientation mode [23]. Tophat is a software application designed to match RNA-Seq reads to a genome. Its purpose is to discover gene expression and exon-exon splice junctions. It is constructed using the high-speed short read mapping software Bowtie2. This software was utilized to create a map using the default settings. value with a threshold of 0.05, the differential genes were sorted by Log2(Foldchange) value. Ultimately, we identified the top 150 genes that were up-regulated and the top 150 genes that were down-regulated as the definitive genes associated with tendinopathy. 2.3.4. Multi-pipeline transcriptomic drug prediction and reranking Tendinopathy signature genes were used as an input in three com- plementary signature-based medication repurposing tools: Connectivity Map, DREIMT and SPIED [13–15]. We obtained four candidate drug lists, with Connectivity Map and DREIMT providing one each, and SPIED’s two databases providing one each. In Connectivity Map, drugs were ranked according to connectivity scores. In DREIMT, 100 drugs are initially screened based on Drug specificity score (DSS) and then drugs are ranked by prioritization score (tau). In SPIED, drugs with negative correlation were selected and ranked according to significance. Every drug list consists of 80 drugs with the highest potential in certain method for reversing tendinopathy at the molecular level (Supplementary Table 1). The Computational Drug Repositioning Score (CoDReS) tool was employed to reevaluate the potential drugs by considering (a) a func- tional score that combines the relevance of drug targets to the disease and the strength of their binding to target genes, (b) an a-priori score that is determined by the initial ranking of drugs in each list, and (c) a structural score that indicates violations in drugability [16]. We con- ducted CoDReS reranking on the top 80 medications from 4 lists. The normalized a-priori repurposing score was calculated by dividing the original ranking score of each drug from the 4 lists by the absolute maximum ranking score. The top 30 drugs based on CoDReS aggregate score were selected for further analysis (Supplementary Table 2). 2.3.5.

The following records were excluded: 1. Titles and abstracts with no data of interest; 2. Studies written in non-English; 3. Studies that do not belong to: in vitro or lab tests, animal studies, editorials, case reports, case series, case-control studies, cohort studies, randomized controlled rials (RCTs), systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs). The keywords and studies included in systematic review are listed in the Supplementary Table s 3 and 4. 2.3.6. Chemical structure diversity analysis and clustering We conducted a thorough search and obtained the molecular struc- tures of the potential pharmaceutical compounds from DrugBank [25]. Next, we obtained the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) format of the compounds from PubChem. This format was then utilized as input in the C-SPADE tool to calculate the distance matrix, which measures the chemical and structural similarities of the compounds [18,26]. The structural similarity was calculated based on Dice similarity coefficient. 2.3.7. Deep learning-based efficacy prediction system The Deep Learning based Efficacy Prediction System (DLEPS) employed a variational autoencoder to encode small molecules in SMILES format. It then utilized a dense network to predict changes in transcriptional profiles based on the latent vectors. Tendinopathy tran- scriptomic signatures and potentially reusable drugs SMILES were used for Online DLEPS system(https://www.dleps.tech/dlep as input s/submit) [17]. 2.3.8.

The two-sample 3 Z. Wang et al.

We have suggested a tool that involves the selection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 100 kb windows from the target gene HMGCR. These SNPs are associated with low-density lipo- protein (LDL) cholesterol levels at a genome-wide significance level (P- value <1 × 10(cid:0) 6). The purpose of this tool is to serve as a proxy for the exposure to statins. In order to optimize the effectiveness of the instru- ment, SNPs employed as instruments were permitted to have a low level of weak linkage disequilibrium (r2 < 0.30) with one another. A GWAS summary data of LDL cholesterol levels obtained from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (GLGC) was utilized to identify SNPs [28]. The data on exposure to mTOR-related genes were collected from the proteomics-GWAS data, which is publicly accessible, in a total of 3301 people from the INTERVAL research [29]. SNPs reaching genome-wide (cid:0) 6) and linkage disequilibrium-pruned (r2 significance (P-value <1 × 10 < 0.05) were included. 2.3.9. Treadmill assessment Following two consecutive days of acclimatization (15 m/min, 30 ◦ ), the rats’ running performance was tested by measuring min/day, 0 their ability to run until exhaustion. In the functional evaluation, the rats ran on a treadmill (SANS, SA101) at an initial speed of 2 m/min, fol- lowed by incremental speeds of 2 m/min2 until they reached a pre- defined exhaustion point (defined as when the animal’s hind limbs remained on the grid for over 10 s, indicating exhaustion). 2.3.10. Histological evaluation Tissue specimens were harvested and fixed in 4 % (v/v) PFA for 24 h at room temperature. After dehydration with gradient alcohol, the samples were embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 6 μm, and per- formed hematoxylin & eosin (HE) and Masson staining. Adapted from a modified version of the Movin grading system [30], the histological evaluation was scored by a blinded scorer using a semi-quantitative scoring system based on H&E staining results. 2.3.11. Protein-protein interaction network construction and visualization Using the STRING database (v.12.0), we constructed a protein- protein interaction network with a medium confidence score of 0.4 using differentially expressed genes as input. We downloaded a tab- separated value format file and imported it into Cytoscape (v.3.9.1) for subsequent interactive analysis. The largest clusters were selected based on the number of nodes to build the visual network. Functional enrichments of the network were performed using gene ontology and TISSUES.

An integrated gene was sub- jected to a pathway enrichment study utilizing a ranked hypergeometric test and a collection of gene sets (c5.all.v7.5.1.symbols from Human Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)) [32]. Subsequently, the family-wise multiple testing correction method was employed to iden- tify the pathways that were significantly enriched in the integrated gene list (Qpathway <0.05). Fold-change in gene expression was used as directional assumptions for prioritizing negatively-associated pairs of tendinopathy/mTOR-inhibition pairs. Significantly enriched pathways (p < 0.05) were visualized using Cytoscape with standard protocols [33]. 2.3.13. Transcriptional overlap analysis We employed rank-rank hypergeometric overlap (RRHO) analysis to determine transcriptional overlap between tendinopathy patients and the collagenase model [20]. The gene lists were ordered and signed based on their level of differential expression in tendinopathy patients and the collagenase model compared to healthy controls, respectively (measured as Log2(Foldchange)). A hypergeometric P-value matrix was generated using repeated statistical tests to assess the proportion of ranking genes that vary between different conditions. The Benjamini and Yekutieli approach was used to accomplish multiple testing correction [34]. The adjusted P-values were visualized using a heat map, where each pixel represents the adjusted –log10 hypergeometric P-values. These values indicate the level of transcriptional overlap be- tween tendinopathy patients and the collagenase model. 2.4. Quantification and statistical analysis 2.4.1. Statistical analysis The primary method of MR analysis employed was inverse variance weighted (IVW) analysis. The weighted median and MR Egger regres- sion methods were employed in additional analysis [35]. The Cocrane’s Q test was employed to ascertain the presence of heterogeneity among the SNPs [36]. A directional pleiotropy measure was calculated based on the intercept obtained from MR Egger regression [37]. A significance level of p < 0.05 was utilized to determine statistical significance. Additionally, MR-PRESSO was employed to identify outlier SNPs [38]. If the presence of horizontal pleiotropy is detected but no heterogeneity is seen, the MR Egger approach will be chosen. If heterogeneity was detected without evidence of pleiotropy, the weight median technique was chosen. A positive result can be considered if the IVW approach yields a significant result (p < 0.05), even if the findings of other methods are not significant, and there is no evidence of pleiotropy and heterogeneity. This is contingent upon the beta values of the other methods being in the same direction [39]. We conducted \"leave-one-out\" studies, where we systematically excluded one SNP at a time, in order to assess the robustness of our findings. The numerical data were displayed as the average value plus or minus the standard deviation. A Student’s t-test was conducted to determine if there were any significant statistical differences between the groups. Statistical significance was attributed to P values less than 0.05.

Integrative pathway enrichment analysis Integrative pathway enrichment analysis was instructed to excavate the potential of mTOR inhibition in clinical tendinopathy treatment. Analysis of differential genes from tendinopathy patients versus healthy controls and WT mice versus mTOR-TKO mice were conducted using the Having a sophisticated candidate drug ranking is essential in order to choose the most promising medications for testing. During the first part of the analysis, we collected 154 clinical tendon samples from patients to acquire highly informed tendinopathy transcriptional signatures. After filtering the p-values with a threshold of 0.05, differentially expressed 4 Z. Wang et al. Computers in Biology and Medicine 186 (2025) 109665 genes were ranked based on Log2(Foldchange) values. Ultimately, we identified the top 150 upregulated genes and the top 150 downregulated genes as the key genes associated with tendinopathy. Secondly, we applied three discrete prediction approaches based on (i) Connectivity Map, (ii) DREIMT and (iii) SPIED. These three drug repurposing tools are complementary in terms of prediction methods and databases. We aim to obtain reliable and comprehensive lists of candidate drugs through their synergistic application (Fig. 1). All medicines listed can be found in Supplementary Table 1. During the last part of the analysis, the Computational Drug Repo- sitioning Score (CoDReS) tool was used to rerank the candidate drugs from multiple lists [16]. In addition to incorporating drug prioritization information from drug repurposing tools, CoDReS also examined other types of drug information. We conducted CoDReS reranking on the top 80 medications based on their weighted normalized score from each of the four drug lists. Fig. 2 illustrates the performance of the top 30 drugs based on the CoDReS aggregate score across different drug prediction pipelines. Step 1: we identified a set of robust tendinopathy signature genes based on a transcriptomics database encompassing 154 clinical tendon samples. Step 2: we conducted multi-pipeline transcriptomic drug pre- diction in three complementary signature-based drug repurposing tools. The connectivity score in Connectivity Map is the proportion of refer- ence gene sets that have a higher resemblance to the perturbagen compared to the current query. The DREIMT Drug specificity score (DSS) summarizes the replicability of a given drug profile across mul- tiple cell lines. The prioritization score (tau) indicates the degree of specificity for a given drug profile-immune signature association pair compared to a large set of drug-immune signatures association pairs in DREIMT’s database. The tendinopathy signature genes in SPIED3 are rated based on their connection with the particular SPIED3 entry using a Z-score derived from a Pearson regression analysis.

Filtering drugs with systematic review and evidence level assessment We conducted a systematic review on the top 30 candidate drugs’ efficacy for tendinopathy (Fig. 3). Information on the related drug, title, publication year, research category, major findings and conclusion are extracted (Supplementary Table 4). Subsequently, we narrowed down the selection of prospective medications for tendinopathy treatment by considering their established evidence. This resulted in a total of 8 candidate drugs, as depicted in Fig. 4. Some preclinical evidence sug- gests the potential effectiveness of diethylstilbestrol, calpeptin, raloxi- fene, and progesterone. We will discuss the statins and sirolimus in greater detail below due to their abundant and high-level evidence. The effectiveness of statins is supported by the highest level of evi- dence. A systematic review included three cohort studies and one case- control study showed that simvastatin can reduce the risk of RCT [40]. A nationwide 11-year follow-up study showed that hyperlipidemia alone was an independent risk factor for RCT. Statins use might provide pro- tection against RCT in patients with hyperlipidemia [41]. However, some studies demonstrated that statins are not beneficial to tendinop- athy, and even lead to tendinopathy. A combined cohort and experi- mental investigation shown that the use of statins raises the clinical risk of tendinopathy by causing the release of matrix metalloproteinases [42]. A animal study evaluated the biomechanical and histopathological effects of statins on the Achilles tendon in rats [43]. The results showed that statins are associated with calcific tendinopathy risk. Overall, the effects of statins are controversial. Consistent evidence from 1 case series, 2 animal studies, and 1 in vitro test indicated the effectiveness of sirolimus. Clinical date indicated that sirolimus is efficient in systemic lupus erythematosus induced tendinopathy [44]. Preclinical studies have shown that sirolimus can alleviate tendon ossification and reverse tendon aging. In our previous study, we found that targeted pathological collagen delivery of sustained release sirolimus can prevent heterotopic tendon ossification [11]. Another study provided evidence that the intake of sirolimus through diet effectively decelerated or halted the natural progression of age-related tendon stiffness and the decline in energy storage capability [45]. Furthermore, a study shown that sirolimus has a partial inhibitory effect on senescence-associated β-gal activity and morphological changes. This suggests that sirolimus can reverse senescence in rat tendon stem/progenitor cells at both the molecular and cellular levels [46].

Deep learning-based drug efficacy prediction In this section, we conducted a re-evaluation of high-potential drugs by integrating drug structure information. Firstly, we constructed and visualized a network depicting structural similarities among drugs to assess structural diversity. We computed the structural distance matrix by utilizing the Dice similarity coefficient to compare all possible pairs of candidate medicines. The hierarchical clustering analysis demon- strated that the input medications exhibited a wide range of chemical structural diversity, as shown in Fig. 5A. Afterwards, we utilized DLEPS to evaluate the effectiveness of medicines. DLEPS is a neural network that use linear representation of chemical structures as input to accu- rately model transcriptional profiles obtained from the L1000 project. This enables researchers to make predictions on the relationship be- tween chemical structure and transcriptional features [17]. DLEPS analysis showed that all eight medications exhibited promising potential in alleviating tendinopathy (Fig. 5B). Statins and sirolimus, which are ranked high in multiplex transcriptional prediction and supported by abundant literature evidence, continue to perform well in DLEPS.

B, Enrichment scores of drug candidates from DLEPS based on tendinopathy gene signatures as the genetic input. Using MR to identify genetic evidence of drugs for tendinopathy treatment. We further explored genetic evidence of statins and sirolimus for tendinopathy treatment (Fig. 6). This study includes two pharmaco- logical targets as exposures: mTOR inhibitors and HMGCR inhibitors. We performed a MR analysis using the summary statistics from a Eu- ropean population-based GWAS dataset. The analysis focused on mTORC1-related proteins in plasma, specifically RP-S6K, EIF4EBP, and EIF-4F components. In addition, we suggested a method in which we chose certain SNPs within 100 kilobase windows from the HMGCR gene, which was linked to LDL cholesterol levels at a significant level across the entire genome. This method serves as a proxy for measuring the effects of statins. GWAS data of RCT was obtained by extracting sum- mary statistics from 299,273 individuals in the FinnGen consortium. This study utilises the connections of the chosen genetic tools to represent the pharmacological adjustment of the drug’s target protein of interest.

Following phosphorylation by mTORC1, PR-S6K triggers the activation of EIF-4B, which in turn exerts a positive regulatory effect on EIF-4F. EIF4E-BP functions as a suppressor of EIF-4E. When phosphorylated by mTORC1, it separates from EIF-4E and subsequently facilitates the formation of the EIF-4F complex. The EIF-4F complex consists of EIF-4E, EIF-4G, and EIF-4A. The outcome of MR is rotator cuff syndrome extracted from the FinnGen consortium. The primary MR analysis uti- lized inverse variance weighted analysis. The study employed weighted median and MR Egger regression methods in supplementary analysis. A proteome-wide MR approach is employed to ascertain the corre- lation between circulating protein levels reliant on mTORC1 and RCT. After removing SNPs that exhibited linkage disequilibrium, outline, or palindromic sequence, a total of 55 SNPs were selected for genetic prediction of mTORC1 downstream proteins (Supplementary Table 6). We evaluated the potency of SNPs employed as the instrument by uti- lizing the F-statistic. To mitigate any potential bias from weak in- struments, we only considered SNPs with an F-statistic greater than 10 [47]. The results indicate that there is evidence linking the higher expression of mTORC1 downstream proteins in blood with an increased risk of RCT in IVW (odds ratio (OR) = 1.03, 95 % confidence interval (cid:0) 3), Weighted median (OR = 1.04, (CI) = 1.01–1.08; P-value = 1.11 × 10 CI = 1.01–1.06; P-value = 0.01) and MR Egger (OR = 1.05, CI = (cid:0) 3), indicating that sirolimus might 1.01–1.08; P-value = 4.11 × 10 lower the risk of RCT (Fig. 7A–C). In addition, the analyses that excluded each SNP showed that no one SNP was responsible for these results. Instead, the results were indicative of a combined pattern (Fig. 7B). The funnel plot displayed no evidence of heterogeneity (Fig. 7D). Next, we examined the causality between HMGCR-mediated LDL cholesterol levels and RCT. From the GWAS summary data of LDL cholesterol levels, a total of 7 SNPs located within or near the HMGCR gene were chosen (Supplementary Table 6).

Validating the therapeutic potential of sirolimus target against clinical tendinopathy Thus far, sirolimus’s potential effectiveness for tendinopathy is supported by evidence from multiple levels. Sirolimus is a highly effective drug that suppresses the immune system. It works by attaching to FK-binding protein-12 and preventing the activation of the protein kinase called mammalian target of sirolimus mycin [48]. In 1999, the US Food and Drug Administration granted approval for sirolimus as a means to avoid the rejection of solid organ transplants. Since then, over the course of the previous two decades, sirolimus has been discovered to be a medicine that is well-tolerated by patients and had an outstanding safety record [48]. We studied the therapeutic efficacy of sirolimus in a tendinopathy model. Treadmill running experiments showed that the sirolimus 7 Z. Wang et al.

In the assessment after four doses, the functional improvement in the sirolimus treatment group compared to the PBS group was statistically significant (Fig. 8B). His- tology indicated that sirolimus treated the tendon calcification induced by collagenase injection and significantly improved histological scores (Fig. 8C and D). Subsequently, Gene Ontology enrichment analysis was performed on the gene expression differences between the sirolimus treatment group and the PBS group, revealing that the sirolimus treat- ment group attenuated skeletal system development and osteoblast differentiation (Fig. 8E). We constructed the protein-protein interaction network and identified key proteins in sirolimus treatment using the 8 Z. Wang et al. Computers in Biology and Medicine 186 (2025) 109665 Fig. 4.

Next, we established a connection between the models and patients using data generated from high-throughput analysis, aiming to investi- gate the effectiveness of sirolimus target in clinical tendinopathy. Firstly, we conducted an integrative pathway enrichment analysis to explore the potentially reversible human tendinopathy molecular 9 Z. Wang et al.

Additionally, we tried to replicate human tendinopathy biological system to observe the impact of mTOR inhibition on the occurrence and progression of tendinopathy. Addi- tionally, we investigated the reliability of the collagenase model in replicating the human tendinopathy biological system to observe the impact of mTOR inhibition on the occurrence and progression of clinical tendinopathy. The therapeutic impact of inhibiting mTOR was examined in a transgenic mouse model, where the mTOR gene was selectively deacti- vated in the tendon lineage [49]. An enrichment analysis was conducted to examine the gene expression changes between the WT and mTOR-TKO mice. The analysis confirmed the validity of mTOR tendon knockout (Fig. 9A). To explore whether mTOR inhibition can treat clinical tendinopathy, we performed an integrative transcriptional analysis across species. We leveraged differential expression analysis data in tendinopathy patients and mTOR-TKO mice versus healthy control, respectively. The pathway analysis was instructed to prioritize tendinopathy/mTOR-inhibition opposed feature pairs. The major findings involved the processes and pathways of cytoplasmic translation, cytoskeletal protein binding and bone morphology (Fig. 9B). We further observed the effect of mTOR inhibition on the occurrence and development of tendinopathy in vivo. Firstly, we demonstrated that the collagenase injection model faithfully replicates the molecular signature of clinical tendinopathy. In order to determine the extent of similarity in gene expression between patients with tendinopathy and the collagenase model, we employed RRHO analysis to compare their transcriptional signatures. Our findings showed a substantial overlap (P- (cid:0) 109) in the genes that were typically upregulated or value = 1.9 × 10 downregulated, as depicted in Fig. 9C. Furthermore, our research revealed common transcriptional alterations across individuals with tendinopathy and the collagenase model (log2Foldchange >2 & p < 10 Z. Wang et al.

The enrichment of overlap differential genes involved “Extracel- lular matrix organization”, “Endochondral ossification” and “Bone mineralization” (Fig. 9D). Subsequently, collagenase was administered by injection into the Achilles tendon of both wild-type (WT) mice and mTOR-TKO mice. Histological staining results showed mTOR-TKO mice exhibited enhanced resistance to tendinopathy. These findings confirmed that sirolimus had strong potential for reversing clinical tendinopathy. 4.

Discussion Our study proposed a systems biology based drug repurposing strategy by leveraging the power of tendon and drug-perturbed tran- scriptomics data database, pre-existing research evidence, and contem- porary statistical methods for causal inference. We have proven that sirolimus is an effective medicine for treating tendinopathy, as sup- ported by evidence from all aspects of our work. Firstly, in the tran- scriptional multiplex drug prediction and drug reranking, sirolimus achieved the top ranking. Secondly, consistent evidence from 1 case series, 2 animal studies, and 1 in vitro test indicated the effectiveness of 11 Z. Wang et al.

Thirdly, sirolimus performed excellently in deep learning based drug efficacy prediction. Fourthly, genetically predicted plasma levels of downstream proteins inhibited by sirolimus increased tendin- opathy risk. Fifthly, after sirolimus treatment, the motor function and histological score of animal models were significantly improved. Sixthly, mTOR-TKO mice exhibited enhanced resistance to tendinopathy. The significance of our findings is especially relevant for patients suffering from calcific tendinopathy. Through integrative pathway enrichment analysis, we identified the clinical tendinopathy pathways that can be reversed by mTOR inhibition. A substantial enrichment of the bone morphology-related pathways indicated that sirolimus may provide potential therapeutic benefits in ameliorating heterotopic ossification in clinical tendinopathy. Despite the high prevalence and incidence of tendinopathy, effective methods for disease relief are currently lacking. Severe tendinopathy can be treated with surgical interventions, but the outcomes are often unsatisfactory [50]. Conventional drug treatments are limited to symptomatic relief, with uncertain efficacy [51]. Our results highlight the potential clinical application of currently available FDA-approved mTOR inhibitors, which could potentially be repurposed for conserva- tive treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy, fundamentally slowing the progression of tendinopathy.

Conventional drug treatments are limited to symptomatic relief, with uncertain efficacy [51]. Our results highlight the potential clinical application of currently available FDA-approved mTOR inhibitors, which could potentially be repurposed for conserva- tive treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy, fundamentally slowing the progression of tendinopathy. We employed many methodologies to offer a holistic outlook on pharmacological repurposing. Transcriptomics drug prediction is based on the principle of signature reversion (SRP), which assumes that if a treatment can reverse the expression pattern of genes that are charac- teristic of a specific disease phenotype, then it may have the ability to reverse the disease phenotype itself [8]. SRP has effectively been utilized to discover new possibilities for repurposing drugs across several fields of therapy [52–54]. However, the drug-perturbed transcriptomics pro- files are obtained from cells [55]. This is perhaps the most fundamental limitation in transcriptomics drug prediction, as much of physiology and pharmacology is non-cell-autonomous. We applied systematic review to supplement the evidence of drugs at the level of tissues and humans. The focused attention on drugs supported by clinical evidence allowed us to efficiently identify candidate drugs. However, it inevitably led to the omission of certain drugs. MR provides a rapid and affordable approach to evaluating causal questions [56]. Genetic variants in MR are used as instrumental variables to examine the possible impact of drug target on disease outcomes in large observational datasets. These variants can be seen as proxies for an intervention on the drug target [57]. However, there is a difference between genetic effect and pharmacological effect. Genetic variants that represent the effects of drugs are the result of tiny changes in drug targets over a person’s lifetime. This is different from a pharmacological intervention in later life, which usually has a larger effect but for a shorter duration [35]. It is for exactly this reason that MR estimates of genetically proxied drug effects are typically greater in magnitude than those observed in clinical practice [58]. Although these restraints make the effectiveness of sirolimus warrants further investi- gation, the consistency between findings supports the robustness of our conclusions. The goal of systems biology is to comprehend physiology and disease from the level of molecules, pathways, cells, tissues, organs and ulti- mately the whole organism [10]. Our drug repurposing strategy employs diverse approaches that span multiple levels to adequately consider the biological complexity of tendinopathy. Three principal approaches in systems biology are plenarily employed in this study: large-scale data 13 generation and mining; in silico simulation; and the use of complex biological systems to assay and model biology [9]. Firstly, the generated profiling data from high-throughput analysis was utilized to: 1) define molecular characteristics of tendinopathy, 2) acquire genetic association data and predict the causal relationship between tendinopathy and drug targets, and 3) establish comprehensive connections between animal models and patients. Secondly, complementary in silico simulations enabled us to integrate diverse information, leading to a sophisticated candidate drug list. Thirdly, we took biological responses as a corner- stone in drug prediction (drug-perturbed","chunk_id":"Wang et al. - 2025 - Sirolimus as a repurposed drug for tendinopathy A systems biology approach combining computational_15","doi":"Wang et al. - 2025 - Sirolimus as a repurposed drug for tendinopathy A systems biology approach combining computational"},{"text":"utilized to: 1) define molecular characteristics of tendinopathy, 2) acquire genetic association data and predict the causal relationship between tendinopathy and drug targets, and 3) establish comprehensive connections between animal models and patients. Secondly, complementary in silico simulations enabled us to integrate diverse information, leading to a sophisticated candidate drug list. Thirdly, we took biological responses as a corner- stone in drug prediction (drug-perturbed transcriptomics profiles from cells) and drug verification (biological system recapitulation, cross-species integration analysis). Nevertheless, this study has some limitations. Our tendinopathy samples were from the rotator cuff, while healthy samples were from the Achilles tendon. The ideal control for this study would have been a matched number of healthy supraspinatus tendon samples; however, in clinical practice, opportunities to collect these samples without impacting patient health are extremely rare. This study conducted a large-scale (n > 100) transcriptome analysis of clinical tendinopathy patients, involving only a single-center cohort of RCT patients. There- fore, the lack of reliable RNA-seq datasets from other sources limits the reproducibility of tendinopathy gene signatures. Besides, we did not consider the disease heterogeneity of tendinopathy. Additional investi- gation is necessary to examine the clinical characteristics and molecular classifications of patients who may experience positive outcomes from sirolimus treatment. 5. Conclusions Our study assimilates knowledge of system-level responses to iden- tify potential drugs for tendinopathy. Sirolimus, a commonly used mTOR inhibitor with a recognized safety profile, has the potential to be repurposed for the treatment of tendinopathy. This could offer a quick road to clinical application. Drug repositioning based on systems biology identifies and targets biologically significant pathways that are essential and can be effectively addressed with pharmacological interventions. We have presented a approach for the repositioning of medications and the development of therapies that are tailored to specific diseases based on their characteristics.
