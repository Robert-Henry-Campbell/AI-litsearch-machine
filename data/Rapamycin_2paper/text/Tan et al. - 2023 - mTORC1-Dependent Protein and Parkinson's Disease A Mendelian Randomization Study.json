Introduction\nThe prevalence of Parkinson’s disease (PD), an age-related neurodegenerative con-\ndition, is increasing at a staggering rate [1]. In addition to decreased dopamine levels,\nit is typiﬁed by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars\ncompacta, which leads to symptoms such as tremors, muscle stiffness, and bradykinesia.\nThe accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn), the major component of Lewy inclusion, has also\nemerged as a prominent neuropathological presentation of PD [2,3]. Unfortunately, there is\ncurrently no cure for PD. The current treatment strategies focus on managing symptoms\nand preventing neuronal death, making the identiﬁcation of new therapeutic targets for\nPD an urgent priority. Understanding the exact causes and mechanisms of the disease will\naid in this effort.\nThere is growing evidence that mTOR plays a key role in modulating the proliferation,\ndifferentiation, and survival of neurons [4]. The mTOR protein kinase is widely present in\nall types of mammalian cells and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including\nprotein synthesis, establishment of the cytoskeleton structure, metabolic regulation, cell\ngrowth, and survival [5,6]. mTOR exists in two distinct complexes: mTOR complex 1\n(mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). mTORC1 is more responsive to rapamycin,\nthe primary inhibitor of mTOR, than mTORC2 [7]. Various stimuli, such as alterations\nin the levels of insulin, energy, and amino acids, are perceived by mTORC1, which is\nfrequently involved in protein synthesis, cell growth, cell proliferation, and autophagy.\nmTORC2, on the other hand, plays a role in cytoskeletal rearrangements [8,9]. Major targets\nBrain Sci. 2023, 13, 536. https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci13040536\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/brainsci"},{"page":2,"text":"Brain Sci. 2023, 13, 536\n2 of 11\nof mTORC1 include ribosomal protein S6K kinase 1 (RPS6K) and eukaryotic initiation factor\n4E-binding proteins (EIF4EBPs). Both of them are the main regulators of cap-dependent\nprotein synthesis and exert their effects on the regulation of protein translation by modulat-\ning transcript initiation and elongation as well as ribosome biosynthesis [5,10]. Meanwhile,\nthe eIF4F complex (eIF4E, eIF4G, and eIF4A) is essential for cap-dependent protein trans-\nlation, which is a rate-limiting step in protein synthesis. RPS6K is a positive regulator\nof eIF4F, while EIF4EBP tightly binds to eIF4E and negatively modulates eIF4F complex\nactivity. Once EIF4EBP is phosphorylated by mTORC1, the dissociation of eIF4E–EIF4EBP\ninitiates 5(cid:48) cap-dependent mRNA translation [11–13]. mTOR is thought to be involved in\nneurodegenerative disorders through its effects on autophagy and protein synthesis.\nIn such disorders, an abnormal mTOR signaling cascade can disrupt autophagy ﬂux,\nleading to the accumulation of protein aggregates and hampering neuron survival [14]. As\na critical regulator involved in cell metabolism and survival, mTOR has been considered\na promising target against Parkinson’s disease. However, the role of mTOR in PD seems\nto be controversial, as both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects have been observed\nin different PD models. The neuroprotective effects induced by mTOR activation seem\nto contradict the beneﬁts of inhibiting mTOR in PD [15]. Therefore, we urgently want to\nknow whether there is a causal relationship between mTORC1 downstream proteins and\nParkinson’s disease, and whether this causality is protective or pathogenic.\nMendelian randomization (MR) analysis is a novel epidemiological method that\nuses summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to infer causality\nbetween exposures and certain diseases and identify potential risk factors. By using genetic\nvariants as instrumental variables for exposures, MR can overcome the confounding factors\nthat are often present in observational studies [16,17]. In this study, we used two-sample\nMR based on GWAS summary statistics of mTORC1-associated proteins in the European\npopulation to investigate the causal association of mTORC1-associated proteins (RPS6K,\nEIF4EBP, EIF-4E, EIF-4G, and EIF4A) with PD.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Data Sources for Exposure\nThe genetic variation of mTORC1-related proteins was extracted from the publicly\navailable Human Plasma Proteome Atlas. The atlas includes data on 3622 plasma proteins\nobtained from 3301 healthy participants undergoing genetic control from the INTERVAL\nstudy [18]. These data link genetic factors to phenotypes based on protein information,\nproviding a basis for potential targets for certain diseases. The INTERVAL study enrolled\napproximately 50,000 participants who were 18 years and older and excluded those with\nmajor diseases. The recruitment took place at 25 centers of England’s National Health\nService Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) from mid-2012 to mid-2014. Blood samples were\ncollected in EDTA tubes after standard venipuncture, and the isolated plasma was stored\nat −80 ◦C for research use [19]. The relative concentrations of 3622 plasma proteins\nwere measured using the SOMAscan assay method, which can simultaneously measure\nextracellular and intracellular proteins as well as expand the lower limit of detection\nfor protein abundance [20]. After a natural log transformation and adjustment for age,\nsex, and duration between the blood draw and linear regression processing, the protein\nconcentrations could be determined [18].\n2.2. Data Sources for the Outcome\nThe summary statistics for genetic studies on PD were gathered by the International\nParkinson’s Disease Genomics Consortium. The data include 33,674 individuals diagnosed\nwith PD and 449,056 controls from European ancestry samples. The analysis was a ﬁxed-\neffects meta-analysis across 17 datasets that all underwent a similar process of quality\ncontrol for inclusion [21]."},{"page":3,"text":"Brain Sci. 2023, 13, 536\n3 of 11\n2.3. Instrumental Variable\nWe established inclusion criteria for selecting instrumental variables in order to obtain\na precise assessment. These criteria include a signiﬁcance threshold of p < 5 × 10−6 and\na linkage disequilibrium (LD) r2 < 0.05. Additionally, single-nucleotide polymorphisms\n(SNPs) with palindromic sequences were removed from the analysis. The acquired instru-\nmental variables were evaluated to ensure that they met the fundamental assumptions\nof a Mendelian randomization analysis (Figure 1): (1) they had to be signiﬁcantly associ-\nated with the exposure of interest; (2) they must not have any relationship with potential\nconfounders, and (3) the association between the instrumental variables and PD must\nbe mediated by the exposure. We also utilized PhenoScanner to verify if any potential\nconfounders were linked to the chosen instrumental variables by the SNPs. Ultimately,\nwe identiﬁed reliable instrumental variables as proxies for the following proteins: RPS6K\n(16 SNPs), EIF4EBP (6 SNPs), EIF4E (13 SNPs), EIF4A (10 SNPs), and EIF4G (7 SNPs).\nFigure 1. Illustrative depiction of the MR study design. SNP, single-nucleotide polymorphism.\n2.4. Mendelian Randomization Analyses\nWe applied several MR methods including inverse-variance-weighted (IVW), weighted\nmedian (WM), and MR–Egger to determine the causal effects between mTORC1-related\nproteins and PD. The IVW results were used as primary information, and a meta-analysis\nwas performed to aggregate the Wald estimates of single SNPs in order to obtain overall\nestimates of mTORC1-related proteins on PD, respectively. These unbiased results were\nbased on the assumption that there was no horizontal pleiotropy [22]. MR–Egger [23] and\nweighted median [24] analyses were used as supplemental evidence for the IVW results\nas they provide more robust estimates under a broad range of scenarios, despite lower\nefﬁciency. The MR-RAPS method can weigh the instrumental variables based on their"},{"page":4,"text":"Brain Sci. 2023, 13, 536\n4 of 11\nstrength, which improves the efﬁciency of MR estimates in the presence of weak instrumen-\ntal variables while also balancing pleiotropy [25]. Additionally, sensitivity analyses were\nconducted to detect potential pleiotropy and heterogeneity. Heterogeneity was reported\nvia Cochran’s Q test (p < 0.05). The intercept of MR–Egger regression provided evidence\nto evaluate horizontal pleiotropy (p < 0.05) [26]. MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier\n(MR-PRESSO) identiﬁed biased variants if they existed and removed them progressively\nto reduce any sign of horizontal pleiotropy [27]. Finally, the leave-one-out method was\nused to test whether any individual SNP confounded the effect estimates, for more robust\nconclusions. All the statistical analyses were carried out using the TwoSampleMR (version\n0.5.6) and MR-PRESSO (version 1.0) packages in R (version 4.2.1). The p-value threshold for\nBonferroni correction was set at 0.01 (0.05/5) to adjust for multiple testing. Results with a\nsigniﬁcance level of less than 0.01 were considered strong evidence of a causal relationship,\nwhile those with a signiﬁcance level between 0.01 and 0.05 were considered indicative\nevidence of a relationship.\n3. Results\nAs seen in Figure 2, the levels of the genetic proxy EIF4EBP were found to have an\ninverse association with the risk of PD (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.67–0.92, p = 0.003). The results\nobtained from WM, MR-PRESSO, and MR-RAPS were consistent, which added conﬁdence\nto the conclusion that this association is likely causal. Additionally, indicative evidence\nwas found for a potential causal effect of EIF4G levels on the risk of PD, whereby higher\nlevels reduced the risk (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.75–0.97, p = 0.014). Similar causal estimates\nwere also obtained using MR-PRESSO (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.82–0.89, p = 0.012) and\nMR-RAPS (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.80–0.91, p = 0.012). The detailed instrumental variables\nin the analysis were listed (Table S1). The impact of individual variables of EIF4EBP and\nEIF4G on PD was further demonstrated through the scatterplot and forest plot presented\nin Figure 3. However, the analysis of the effects of RPS6K, EIF4A, and EIF4E levels on the\nrisk of PD did not reach statistical signiﬁcance. The Cochran’s Q test p-values for all of\nthese were more than 0.05, indicating that no obvious heterogeneity was observed. Further-\nmore, the MR–Egger regression intercept showed no evidence of unbalanced pleiotropy\n(all p > 0.05) (Table 1). The global test of MR-PRESSO also did not identify any pleiotropic\nbias. In addition, the absence of any signiﬁcant SNPs in the leave-one-out sensitivity\nanalysis (Figure 4) suggests that no individual SNP could disrupt the causal relationship.\nTable 1.

Discussion\nAs far as we know, this study is the initial investigation into the causal connection\nbetween the levels of mTORC1-dependent proteins (including RPS6K, EIF4EBP, EIF-4E,\nEIF-4A, and EIF-4G) and PD using MR methods and eliminating potential confounding\nfactors through genetic variations. Utilizing data from the INTERVAL study on human\nplasma protein arrays and GWAS summary statistics from the International Parkinson’s\nDisease Genomics Consortium (IPDGC), we conducted a two-sample MR analysis. The\nMR study indicated a negative correlation between the levels of the EIF4EBP protein in\nthe plasma (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.67–0.92, p = 0.003) and PD risk. We also discovered\nsuggestive evidence of a protective effect of the plasma protein levels of EIF4G on PD\n(OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.75–0.97, p = 0.014), despite the p-value not being signiﬁcant after\nBonferroni correction. However, no clear evidence was found to support a causal effect of\nthe gene-predicted RP-S6K, EIF-4E, and EIF-4A on PD risk. Sensitivity analyses also did\nnot reveal any signiﬁcant imbalanced pleiotropy or heterogeneity, indicating that the MR\nestimates were independent and robust.\nThe mechanism by which mTOR regulates the survival of dopamine-producing neu-\nrons is still largely unknown. The inhibition of mTORC1 with rapamycin has been shown\nto decrease the levels of PARK7/DJ1, a protein linked to neurodegeneration that has beneﬁ-\ncial molecular chaperone and antioxidant properties and whose translation depends on\nmTORC1. Loss-of-function mutations in PARK7 are associated with early-onset, recessive\nforms of Parkinson’s disease [28]. The mTOR signaling pathway is essential for regulating\nprotein synthesis and cell survival; thus, it is important to keep it active for its protective\nrole in neurons. However, the ﬁne-tuning of mTOR activation may be necessary during\nParkinson’s disease. mTORC1 controls both protein synthesis through translation and pro-\ntein degradation through autophagy. It negatively regulates autophagy by phosphorylating\nAtg13 and ULK1/2, inhibiting the formation of autophagosomes [29,30]. Alpha-synuclein\naccumulation is a hallmark of Parkinson’s disease, and it is believed to play a key role\nin the death of dopamine-producing neurons. By inhibiting mTOR, rapamycin promotes\nautophagy, which is a process by which cells degrade and recycle waste proteins and\ndamaged cellular components. By increasing autophagy, rapamycin may help to prevent\nthe accumulation of toxic alphasynuclein and protect dopamine-producing neurons from\ndeath. This highlights the potential therapeutic value of mTOR inhibition for treating\nParkinson’s disease [31]. In summary, excessive or inadequate mTOR activity can be lethal\nto neurons.\nEIF4EBP is a crucial component of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, and its activity\nis tightly regulated by the balance of its phosphorylation levels. When EIF4EBP is un-\nderphosphorylated, it binds strongly to eIF4E, thus inhibiting cap-dependent translation\ninitiation. However, when excessive phosphorylation occurs, EIF4EBP is released from\neIF4E, resulting in increased cap-dependent translation [32,33]. The postmortem analysis\nof the brains of PD patients suggests oxidative stress as a potential mechanism of neu-\nrodegeneration. This is indicated by a lack of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) and the\ninhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity in the substantia nigra, along with increased\nsuperoxide dismutase (SOD) activity [34]. It has been proven that EIF4EBP is crucial for\nsurvival during stressful conditions, including starvation and oxidative stress. Activated\nEIF4EBP induces a rapid halt in cap-dependent translation, promoting the upregulation of\nstress response factors, such as antioxidants and molecular chaperones [35–37]. CHCHD2\nis a mitochondrial protein-encoding gene that controls oxidative phosphorylation by regu-\nlating Cyt c and crista integrity. Dominant mutations in this gene are the cause of late-onset\nPD [38]. In a limited case study, several exonic variants that may affect CHCHD2 protein\nlevels or subcellular localization showed an association with Parkinson’s disease [39]. In\nDrosophila, the loss of CHCHD2 can lead to abnormalities in the mitochondrial matrix\nstructure and impaired mitochondrial respiration, which exacerbates the sensitivity to\noxidative stress, loss of dopaminergic neurons, and motor dysfunction associated with\nParkinson’s disease. In addition to these PD pathological phenotypes, a compensatory"},{"page":8,"text":"Brain Sci. 2023, 13, 536\n8 of 11\nupregulation of 4E-BP was also observed. These PD-related phenotypes were alleviated\nby the overexpression of the translation inhibitor 4E-BP and the introduction of human\nCHCHD2. By introducing 4E-BP into dCHCHD2-/-Drosophila, the general expression of\n4E-BP decreased the ATP decline in drosophila. The same outcome was achieved by admin-\nistering rapamycin, which activates 4E-BP by inhibiting the kinase target of rapamycin [40].\nMitochondrial dysfunction is a prominent feature of PD, and the beneﬁcial role of 4E-BP in\nmitochondria reverses PD pathological phenotypes. Additionally, mutations in PINK1 and\nparkin lead to autosomal recessive hereditary Parkinson’s disease. Drosophila with PINK1\nand parkin mutations display dopaminergic neurodegeneration, motor defects, and mito-\nchondrial dysfunction. These mutations are associated with signiﬁcant reductions in the\nphosphorylated levels of EIF4EBP, with corresponding increases in the proportion of active\nnonphosphorylated EIF4EBP. The over-expression of EIF4EBP can suppress all pathological\nphenotypes, and the loss of EIF4EBP function signiﬁcantly reduces the survival ability\nof parkin and PINK1 mutants. In vivo, EIF4EBP can be activated by the TOR inhibitor\nrapamycin [41]. Moreover, LRRK2 homologous mutations in Drosophila can produce PD\nphenotypes similar to those caused by parkin/PINK1 mutations, the most common genetic\ncause of PD [42]. LRRK2 contains both an active GTPase and kinase domain, which can\npromote cap-dependent translation and exhibit strong genetic interactions with the core\nmembers and regulators of the cap-binding protein complex. Generally, disease-associated\nmutations in LRRK2 often increase its kinase activity, thereby enhancing its toxicity. To\ndate, a large number of LRRK2 mutations have been identiﬁed, with the G2019S variant\nbeing the most common. This mutation leads to increased protein synthesis in neurons,\nexhibiting the age-related loss of dopaminergic neurons and motor dysfunction, which can\nbe improved by blocking the synthesis with protein synthesis inhibitors [43,44]. LRRK2\nacts as a protein translation regulator by phosphorylating the 4E-BP protein at the T37/T46\nsite both in vitro and in vivo. However, the control of translation initiation is closely related\nto stress and lifespan, and these phosphorylation events appear to have important effects\non stress sensitivity and dopaminergic neuron survival in LRRK2 mutant Drosophila. On\nthe one hand, the overexpression of eIF4E and dLRRK leads to age-related phenotypes\nin DA neurons, whose gene expression pattern is consistent with gene expression under\noxidative stress and aging conditions. This strongly suggests that a chronic decline in 4E-BP\nactivity promotes oxidative stress and subsequent aging in DA neurons. On the other\nhand, it has been observed that the overexpression of 4E-BP or a reduction in dLRRK levels\ncan provide protection in Drosophila models of PINK1 and parkin pathology [41,44,45].\nThis suggests that regulating 4E-BP expression to suppress the accumulation of abnormal\nprotein is beneﬁcial. In our study, we revealed an inverse association between the levels\nof the genetic proxy EIF4EBP and PD risk. This is consistent with the observed effects in\nexperimental studies.\nThe expression of speciﬁc target genes and protein levels in circulation can be mod-\nulated, making them potential targets for preventing PD. Given the mounting evidence\nimplicating the mTOR signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of PD, it is unclear whether\nthere is a causal relationship between mTORC1-related proteins and PD. Using epidemio-\nlogical research methods, we determined in this study that an increase in EIF4EBP protein\nlevels can help prevent PD, as previously observed in experimental studies. The disclo-\nsure of this unbiased causal relationship will guide a direction for future PD prevention\nand provide a potential intervention target, while also requiring further basic research to\nuncover potential pathophysiological mechanisms. In conclusion, targeting the mTOR\npathway pharmacologically has promising potential as a treatment for PD. Further work\nis needed to fully understand the nuanced regulation of mTOR and its complex cellular\npathways. It is crucial to continue the development of mTOR signaling modulators that\nmeet therapeutic goals, while mitigating the adverse effects of current mTOR regulators, to\nachieve the desired clinical outcomes without negative consequences. The pharmacologic\nactivation of EIF4EBP activity may represent a viable treatment option for PD."},{"page":9,"text":"Brain Sci. 2023, 13, 536\n9 of 11\nOne advantage of this study is the use of MR design. As alleles are randomly assigned\nand ﬁxed at conception, it minimizes the potential for observed associations to be biased by\nreverse causation and confounding. Secondly, we employed various MR methods including\nIVW, MR–Egger, WM, and MR-RAPS to robustly estimate causal relationships. MR–Egger\nregression and MR-PRESSO were used to detect pleiotropy to ensure the robustness of\nthe conclusions. Thirdly, we provided robust genetic instruments by using multiple SNPs\nas instrumental variables for mTORC1-related proteins. Fourthly, our analysis utilized\na large sample size with no overlap between the exposure and outcome, thereby result-\ning in high statistical power for most of the analyses. This study has several limitations.\nFirstly, all the GWAS data were from individuals of European ancestry, and it remains\nto be determined whether the results observed in this study are generalizable to other\npopulations. Therefore, future studies utilizing MR to investigate the causal relationship\nbetween mTORC1-dependent proteins (including RPS6K, EIF4EBP, EIF-4E, EIF-4A, and\nEIF-4G) and PD should consider including samples from different ethnic groups to increase\nthe generalizability of the ﬁndings. Secondly, as the study used summary statistics data\nand not individual-level data, it was not possible to conduct a subgroup analysis. Thirdly,\nthe genetic variants used in MR studies reﬂect lifetime exposure and speciﬁc causal associa-\ntions, whereas randomized controlled trials only report the effects of short-term exposure.\nTherefore, it is difﬁcult to determine the effects of short-term exposure to high levels of\nEIF4EBP proteins on PD risk and to understand the effectiveness of any interventions.\n5. Conclusions\nThis unbiased MR study highlights the protective role of serum EIF4EBP levels in\nPD. Further research is required regarding the study of EIF4EBP’s role.
