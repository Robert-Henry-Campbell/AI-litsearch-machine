Applying systems biology to identify new applications for current pharmaceuticals can decrease \nthe duration, expenses, and likelihood of failure associated with the development of new drugs.\nMethods:  We  identify  tendinopathy  signature  genes  employing  a  transcriptomics  database  encompassing  154 \nclinical tendon samples. We then proposed a systems biology based drug prediction strategy that encompassed \nmultiplex transcriptional drug prediction, systematic review assessment, deep learning based efficacy prediction \nand Mendelian randomization (MR). Finally, we evaluated the effects of drug target using gene knockout mice.\nResults:  We  demonstrate  that  sirolimus  is  a  repurposable  drug  for  tendinopathy,  supported  by:  1)  Sirolimus \nachieves  top  ranking  in  drug-gene  signature-based  multiplex  transcriptional  drug  efficacy  prediction,  2) \nConsistent evidence from systematic review substantiates the efficacy of sirolimus in the management of ten-\ndinopathy, 3) Genetic prediction indicates that plasma proteins inhibited by mTOR (the target of sirolimus) are \nassociated with increased tendinopathy risk. The effectiveness of sirolimus is further corroborated through in \nvivo testing utilizing tendon tissue–specific mTOR gene knockout mice. Integrative pathway enrichment analysis \nsuggests  that  mTOR  inhibition  can  regulate  heterotopic  ossification-related  pathways  to  ameliorate  clinical \ntendinopathy.\nConclusions: Our study assimilates knowledge of system-level responses to identify potential drugs for tendin-\nopathy, and suggests sirolimus as a viable candidate. A systems biology approach could expedite the repurposing \nof drugs for human diseases that do not have well-defined targets.\n1. Background\nTendinopathy is a prevalent musculoskeletal condition, representing \naround 30 % of musculoskeletal appointments in general practice [1]. \nThe rotator cuff is the area most prone to injury, with a prevalence rate \nas high as 5.5 % in the whole population [1]. Each year, more than 200, \n000 surgical procedures are carried out in the United States to repair the \nrotator cuff in cases of severe rotator cuff tendinopathy (RCT). These \ntreatments contribute to healthcare expenses amounting to around 474 \nmillion dollars [2]. At now, arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is the main \nmethod used to treat RCT. It enhances the functional scores of shoulder \njoint and reduces pain symptoms in patients [3]. Nevertheless, patients \n* Corresponding author.

Over the years, corticosteroid injections have been the \nmainstay  pharmacological  treatment  for  tendinopathy.  Nevertheless, \nthe effectiveness of corticosteroid injections remains controversial [5]. \nIn  conclusion,  there  is  an  urgent  need  for  effective  pharmacological \ntreatment for tendinopathy.\nThe  process  of  drug  discovery  is  typically  inefficient,  marked  by \nescalating expenses, lengthy duration, and a high percentage of wastage \n[6].  Drug  repurposing  is  a  strategy  that  involves  using  existing  phar-\nmaceuticals  that  have  already  been  thoroughly  investigated  for  their \nsafety  and  pharmacokinetic  characteristics  to  treat  different  medical \nconditions [7]. Sildenafil, initially an antihypertensive, was repurposed \nby Pfizer for erectile dysfunction. By 2012, it held a 47 % market share, \nwith global sales of $2.05 billion [8]. The typical cost of introducing a \nrepurposed medicine to the market is projected to be around US$300 \nmillion, while a novel chemical entity is anticipated to cost between US \n$2–3 billion [7]. However, even in the case of medications that already \nexist,  the  procedure  of  conducting  experimental  preclinical  screening \nfollowed  by  human  safety  and  efficacy  studies  is  arduous  and \ntime-consuming.  Hence,  it  is  imperative  to  prioritize  the  candidate \nmedications.\nOver the past few decades, there has been substantial advancement \nand  extensive  adoption  of  high-throughput  technologies,  leading  to  a \ndramatic surge in the volume of omics data. There is a wealth of publicly \navailable research that extensively examines the relationship between \ngenetic  variation  and  the  effectiveness  of  treatment.  The  intricacy  of \ndisease  biology  and  the  necessity  for  customized  treatment  can  be \naddressed by a systematic approach that relies on high-throughput data \nto confront significant obstacles in drug repurposing. In this regard, the \napplication  of  systems  biology  might  accelerate  the  process  of  priori-\ntizing  candidate  drugs  by  utilizing  various  strategies  to  thoroughly \nexamine and integrate the existing information on a specific drug [8]. \nThe  goal  of  systems  biology  is  to  understand  physiology  and  disease \nfrom the levels of molecular pathways, regulatory networks, cells, tis-\nsues, organs, and ultimately the entire organism [9]. Drug repositioning \nbased on systems biology can be defined as: in drug repositioning under \nspecific drug conditions, the use of high-throughput genomic data from \nhumans and various model organisms. These different types of data are \nintegrated using systems biology approaches, including network-based \nand  signature-based  methods;  the  predicted  outputs  are  validated  in \ndifferent model organisms [10].\nThis work presents a systems biology approach to identify prospec-\ntive  treatment  candidates  for  tendinopathy  by  1)  applying  multiplex \ntranscriptional  drug  prediction  based  on  a  clinical  tendon  tran-\nscriptomics  database,  2)  screening  candidates  through  systematic  re-\nview and evidence level assessment, 3) evaluating high-potential drugs \nthrough  deep  learning  integrating  drug  structure  information,  and  4) \nexploring  genetic  evidence  of  drugs  for  tendinopathy  treatment  in \nMendelian  randomization  (MR)  analyses.  Finally,  we  validated  thera-\npeutic  potential  of  the  sirolimus  target  against  clinical  tendinopathy \nbased on animal models.\n2. Methods\n2.1.

The  patient’s  consent  and  clearance  from  the  local  ethics \ncommittee  were  acquired  (Ethics  Committee  of  the  second  Affiliated \nHospital,  School  of  Medicine,  Zhejiang  University,  code:  2019-168, \n2020-080).\n2.2.2. Experimental model\nThe  Zhejiang  University  Experimental  Animal  Welfare  and  Ethics \nCommittee approved animal studies in accordance with the guidelines of \nInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committee (ZJU20220006).\nIn the in vivo drug experiment, 12 8-week-old rats (equal numbers of \nmales and females) were induced with tendinopathy by injecting 30U \nType  I  collagenase  (Gibco,  17100017)  into  the  midportion  of  the \nAchilles tendon of 8-week-old rats. The same procedure was repeated \nafter 3 days to stabilize the effect. Divide the 12 rats into two groups, \nwith  each  rat  receiving  four  subcutaneous  injections  (between  the \nAchilles tendon and the skin, every 3 days) one week after modeling: the \ncontrol group (sterile PBS, 20 μL) and the sirolimus group (sirolimus, \n70uM, 20 μL). Weekly assessments of motor function were conducted on \nthe  rats  after  modeling,  followed  by  euthanasia  for  transcriptomic \nsequencing and histological evaluation.\nThe effectiveness of sirolimus is further corroborated through in vivo \ntesting utilizing tendon tissue–specific mTOR gene knockout mice. The \ntendinopathy was generated by injecting 12.5 U of type 1 collagenase \n(Gibco, 17100017) into the middle of the right Achilles tendons of 8- \nweek-old mice. The same operation was performed 3 days later to sta-\nbilize the effect. At 6 weeks following modeling, 8 wild-type (WT) mice \nand 8 mTOR tendon knockout (mTOR-TKO) mice were euthanized. The \nlegs were then excised for histopathology.\n2.3. Method details\n2.3.1. RNA sequence\nThe tissue was subjected to RNA extraction using TRIzol® Reagent \nfollowing  the  directions  provided  by  the  manufacturer  (Invitrogen). \nSubsequently, DNase I (TaKara) was used to eliminate genomic DNA. \nThe  RNA-seq  transcriptome  libraries  were  generated  using  the  Tru-\nSeqTM RNA sample preparation Kit from Illumina (San Diego, CA). A \ntotal of 1 μg of RNA was used for this process. In brief, messenger RNA \nwas extracted using polyA selection through oligo(dT) beads and sub-\nsequently  fragmented  using  a  fragmentation  buffer.  The  process \ninvolved  in  this  study  included  cDNA  synthesis,  end  repair,  A-base \naddition, and ligation of the Illumina-indexed adaptors, following the \nmethodology  provided  by  Illumina.  The  libraries  were  subsequently \nchosen  based  on  their  size,  specifically  cDNA  target  fragments  of \n200–300  bp,  using  2  %  Low  Range  Ultra  Agarose.  These  selected  li-\nbraries  were  then  subjected  to  PCR  amplification using  Phusion  DNA \npolymerase (NEB) for a total of 15 PCR cycles. Following quantification \nusing  the  TBS380,  the  paired-end  libraries  were  sequenced  using  the \nIllumina HiSeq with a run length of 2X150bp.\n2.3.2. Reads quality control and mapping\nThe  unprocessed  paired  end  readings  underwent  trimming  and \nquality checking using Trimmomatic with the default parameters (htt \np://www.usadellab.org/cms/uploads/supplementary/Trimmomatic). \nThe clean reads were aligned to the reference genome using the hisat2 \nsoftware  in  orientation  mode  [23].  Tophat  is  a  software  application \ndesigned to match RNA-Seq reads to a genome. Its purpose is to discover \ngene expression and exon-exon splice junctions. It is constructed using \nthe high-speed short read mapping software Bowtie2. This software was \nutilized to create a map using the default settings.\nvalue  with  a  threshold  of  0.05,  the  differential  genes  were  sorted  by \nLog2(Foldchange)  value.  Ultimately,  we  identified  the  top  150  genes \nthat were up-regulated and the top 150 genes that were down-regulated \nas the definitive genes associated with tendinopathy.\n2.3.4. Multi-pipeline transcriptomic drug prediction and reranking\nTendinopathy signature genes were used as an input in three com-\nplementary signature-based medication repurposing tools: Connectivity \nMap,  DREIMT  and  SPIED  [13–15].  We  obtained  four  candidate  drug \nlists,  with  Connectivity  Map  and  DREIMT  providing  one  each,  and \nSPIED’s two databases providing one each. In Connectivity Map, drugs \nwere ranked according to connectivity scores. In DREIMT, 100 drugs are \ninitially screened based on Drug specificity score (DSS) and then drugs \nare ranked by prioritization score (tau). In SPIED, drugs with negative \ncorrelation were selected and ranked according to significance. Every \ndrug list consists of 80 drugs with the highest potential in certain method \nfor reversing tendinopathy at the molecular level (Supplementary Table \n1).\nThe  Computational  Drug  Repositioning  Score  (CoDReS)  tool  was \nemployed to reevaluate the potential drugs by considering (a) a func-\ntional score that combines the relevance of drug targets to the disease \nand the strength of their binding to target genes, (b) an a-priori score \nthat is determined by the initial ranking of drugs in each list, and (c) a \nstructural  score  that  indicates  violations  in  drugability  [16].  We  con-\nducted CoDReS reranking on the top 80 medications from 4 lists. The \nnormalized  a-priori  repurposing  score  was  calculated  by  dividing  the \noriginal  ranking  score  of  each  drug  from  the  4  lists  by  the  absolute \nmaximum ranking score. The top 30 drugs based on CoDReS aggregate \nscore were selected for further analysis (Supplementary Table 2).\n2.3.5. Systematic review\nA search on the Medline database using PubMed as the search engine \nwas conducted reviewing a combination of 36 different keywords, tar-\ngeting  articles  related  to  using  the  candidate  drugs  for  tendinopathy \ntreatment released between 2013 and 2022. The following records were \nexcluded:  1.  Titles  and  abstracts  with  no  data  of  interest;  2.  Studies \nwritten in non-English; 3. Studies that do not belong to: in vitro or lab \ntests,  animal  studies,  editorials,  case  reports,  case  series,  case-control \nstudies, cohort studies, randomized controlled rials (RCTs), systematic \nreviews  (SRs)  and  meta-analyses  (MAs).  The  keywords  and  studies \nincluded in systematic review are listed in the Supplementary Table s 3 \nand 4.\n2.3.6. Chemical structure diversity analysis and clustering\nWe conducted a thorough search and obtained the molecular struc-\ntures of the potential pharmaceutical compounds from DrugBank [25]. \nNext,  we  obtained  the  Simplified  Molecular  Input  Line  Entry  System \n(SMILES)  format  of  the  compounds  from  PubChem.  This  format  was \nthen  utilized  as  input  in  the  C-SPADE  tool  to  calculate  the  distance \nmatrix, which measures the chemical and structural similarities of the \ncompounds [18,26]. The structural similarity was calculated based on \nDice similarity coefficient.\n2.3.7. Deep learning-based efficacy prediction system\nThe  Deep  Learning  based  Efficacy  Prediction  System  (DLEPS) \nemployed  a  variational  autoencoder  to  encode  small  molecules  in \nSMILES format. It then utilized a dense network to predict changes in \ntranscriptional profiles based on the latent vectors. Tendinopathy tran-\nscriptomic signatures and potentially reusable drugs SMILES were used \nfor  Online  DLEPS  system(https://www.dleps.tech/dlep \nas \ninput \ns/submit) [17].\n2.3.8.

Tendinopathy signature genes identification\nDESeq2 is used to identify the differential genes between tendinop-\nathy  samples  and  healthy  tendon  samples  [24].  After  filtering  the  p \nMR  was  employed  to  examine  causal  associations  between  drug \ntargets and tendinopathy using the MR-Base TwoSampleMR package in \nR (https://github.com/MRCIEU/TwoSampleMR) [22].

Each of these investigations had obtained approval from the appro-\npriate  institutional  review  boards,  and  participants  had  given  their \ninformed permission.\nGWAS  data of  RCT  was  obtained by  extracting summary statistics \nfrom 299,273 individuals of European ancestry from the FinnGen con-\nsortium (R9 release) [27]. The FinnGen Study is a comprehensive ge-\nnetic study conducted in Finland, involving a nationwide meta-analysis \nof 9 biobanks. Importantly, the samples used in this study were distinct \nand did not overlap with those used in the plasma proteome GWAS. The \nGWAS conducted in the FinnGen Study involved a total of 24,061 in-\ndividuals  diagnosed  with  rotator  cuff  syndrome  and  275,212  persons \nwithout the condition who served as controls. The rotator cuff syndrome \nwas defined according to the international classification of diseases-10 \n(ICD-10):  Rotator  cuff  or  supraspinatus  tear  or  rupture  (complete  or \nincomplete), not specified as traumatic supraspinatus syndrome.\nWe  have  suggested  a  tool  that  involves  the  selection  of  single \nnucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  within  100  kb  windows  from  the \ntarget gene HMGCR. These SNPs are associated with low-density lipo-\nprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels at a genome-wide significance level (P- \nvalue <1 × 10(cid:0) 6). The purpose of this tool is to serve as a proxy for the \nexposure to statins. In order to optimize the effectiveness of the instru-\nment, SNPs employed as instruments were permitted to have a low level \nof weak linkage disequilibrium (r2  < 0.30) with one another. A GWAS \nsummary data of LDL cholesterol levels obtained from the Global Lipids \nGenetics  Consortium  (GLGC)  was  utilized  to  identify  SNPs  [28].  The \ndata  on  exposure  to  mTOR-related  genes  were  collected  from  the \nproteomics-GWAS data, which is publicly accessible, in a total of 3301 \npeople from the INTERVAL research [29]. SNPs reaching genome-wide \n(cid:0) 6) and linkage disequilibrium-pruned (r2 \nsignificance (P-value <1 × 10\n< 0.05) were included.\n2.3.9. Treadmill assessment\nFollowing  two  consecutive  days  of  acclimatization  (15 m/min,  30 \n◦\n), the rats’  running performance was tested by measuring \nmin/day, 0\ntheir ability to run until exhaustion. In the functional evaluation, the rats \nran on a treadmill (SANS, SA101) at an initial speed of 2 m/min, fol-\nlowed  by  incremental  speeds  of  2  m/min2  until  they  reached  a  pre-\ndefined  exhaustion  point  (defined  as  when  the  animal’s  hind  limbs \nremained on the grid for over 10 s, indicating exhaustion).\n2.3.10. Histological evaluation\nTissue specimens were harvested and fixed in 4 % (v/v) PFA for 24 h \nat  room  temperature.  After  dehydration  with  gradient  alcohol,  the \nsamples  were  embedded  in  paraffin  and  sectioned  at  6  μm,  and  per-\nformed hematoxylin & eosin (HE) and Masson staining. Adapted from a \nmodified  version  of  the  Movin  grading  system  [30],  the  histological \nevaluation  was  scored  by  a  blinded  scorer  using  a  semi-quantitative \nscoring system based on H&E staining results.\n2.3.11. Protein-protein interaction network construction and visualization\nUsing  the  STRING  database  (v.12.0),  we  constructed  a  protein- \nprotein  interaction  network  with  a  medium  confidence  score  of  0.4 \nusing  differentially  expressed  genes  as  input.  We  downloaded  a  tab- \nseparated  value  format  file  and  imported  it  into  Cytoscape  (v.3.9.1) \nfor  subsequent  interactive  analysis. The largest  clusters were selected \nbased on the number of nodes to build the visual network. Functional \nenrichments of the network were performed using gene ontology and \nTISSUES.\nActivePathways R package [21]. ActivePathways utilized the Brown’s \nversion  of  the  Fisher’s  combined  probability  test  to  generate  an  inte-\ngrated  gene  list.  This  list  combines  the  significance  (P-values)  from \nmany datasets for each input gene [31]. An integrated gene was sub-\njected to a pathway enrichment study utilizing a ranked hypergeometric \ntest  and  a  collection  of  gene  sets  (c5.all.v7.5.1.symbols  from  Human \nMolecular  Signatures  Database  (MSigDB))  [32].  Subsequently,  the \nfamily-wise multiple testing correction method was employed to iden-\ntify the pathways that were significantly enriched in the integrated gene \nlist  (Qpathway <0.05).  Fold-change  in  gene  expression  was  used  as \ndirectional  assumptions  for  prioritizing  negatively-associated  pairs  of \ntendinopathy/mTOR-inhibition pairs.  Significantly enriched  pathways \n(p  < 0.05)  were  visualized  using  Cytoscape  with  standard  protocols \n[33].\n2.3.13. Transcriptional overlap analysis\nWe employed rank-rank hypergeometric overlap (RRHO) analysis to \ndetermine  transcriptional  overlap  between  tendinopathy  patients  and \nthe  collagenase  model  [20].  The  gene  lists  were  ordered  and  signed \nbased on their level of differential expression in tendinopathy patients \nand the collagenase model compared to healthy controls, respectively \n(measured as Log2(Foldchange)). A hypergeometric P-value matrix was \ngenerated  using  repeated  statistical  tests  to  assess  the  proportion  of \nranking  genes  that  vary  between  different  conditions.  The  Benjamini \nand  Yekutieli  approach  was  used  to  accomplish  multiple  testing \ncorrection [34]. The adjusted P-values were visualized using a heat map, \nwhere  each  pixel  represents  the  adjusted  –log10  hypergeometric \nP-values. These values indicate the level of transcriptional overlap be-\ntween tendinopathy patients and the collagenase model.\n2.4. Quantification and statistical analysis\n2.4.1. Statistical analysis\nThe primary method of MR analysis employed was inverse variance \nweighted (IVW) analysis. The weighted median and MR Egger regres-\nsion methods were employed in additional analysis [35]. The Cocrane’s \nQ test was employed to ascertain the presence of heterogeneity among \nthe SNPs [36]. A directional pleiotropy measure was calculated based on \nthe intercept obtained from MR Egger regression [37]. A significance \nlevel  of  p  < 0.05  was  utilized  to  determine  statistical  significance. \nAdditionally, MR-PRESSO was employed to identify outlier SNPs [38]. If \nthe presence of horizontal pleiotropy is detected but no heterogeneity is \nseen,  the  MR  Egger  approach  will  be  chosen.  If  heterogeneity  was \ndetected without evidence of pleiotropy, the weight median technique \nwas  chosen.  A  positive  result  can  be  considered  if  the  IVW  approach \nyields  a  significant  result  (p  < 0.05),  even  if  the  findings  of  other \nmethods are not significant, and there is no evidence of pleiotropy and \nheterogeneity.  This  is  contingent  upon  the  beta  values  of  the  other \nmethods being in the same direction [39]. We conducted \"leave-one-out\" \nstudies, where we systematically excluded one SNP at a time, in order to \nassess the robustness of our findings. The numerical data were displayed \nas the average value plus or minus the standard deviation. A Student’s \nt-test was conducted to determine if there were any significant statistical \ndifferences between the groups. Statistical significance was attributed to \nP values less than 0.05. The significance level is denoted as *P < 0.05, \n**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001.\n3. Results\n3.1. Multiplex transcriptional prediction and drug reranking\n2.3.12.

Ultimately, we \nidentified the top 150 upregulated genes and the top 150 downregulated \ngenes  as  the  key  genes  associated  with  tendinopathy.  Secondly,  we \napplied three discrete prediction approaches based on (i) Connectivity \nMap, (ii) DREIMT and (iii) SPIED. These three drug repurposing tools \nare complementary in terms of prediction methods and databases. We \naim  to  obtain  reliable  and  comprehensive  lists  of  candidate  drugs \nthrough their synergistic application (Fig. 1). All medicines listed can be \nfound in Supplementary Table 1.\nDuring the last part of the analysis, the Computational Drug Repo-\nsitioning Score (CoDReS) tool was used to rerank the candidate drugs \nfrom multiple lists [16]. In addition to incorporating drug prioritization \ninformation from drug repurposing tools, CoDReS also examined other \ntypes of drug information. We conducted CoDReS reranking on the top \n80 medications based on their weighted normalized score from each of \nthe four drug lists. Fig. 2 illustrates the performance of the top 30 drugs \nbased on the CoDReS aggregate score across different drug prediction \npipelines.\nStep 1: we identified a set of robust tendinopathy signature genes \nbased on a transcriptomics database encompassing 154 clinical tendon \nsamples. Step 2: we conducted multi-pipeline transcriptomic drug pre-\ndiction in three complementary signature-based drug repurposing tools. \nThe connectivity score in Connectivity Map is the proportion of refer-\nence  gene  sets  that  have  a  higher  resemblance  to  the  perturbagen \ncompared  to  the  current  query.

Step 3: we reranked \ndrugs using CoDReS based on a combination of functional and structural \ncriteria.\n3.2. Filtering drugs with systematic review and evidence level assessment\nWe conducted a systematic review on the top 30 candidate drugs’ \nefficacy for tendinopathy (Fig. 3). Information on the related drug, title, \npublication year, research category, major findings and conclusion are \nextracted (Supplementary Table 4). Subsequently, we narrowed down \nthe selection of prospective medications for tendinopathy treatment by \nconsidering  their  established  evidence.  This  resulted  in  a  total  of  8 \ncandidate drugs, as depicted in Fig. 4. Some preclinical evidence sug-\ngests the potential effectiveness of diethylstilbestrol, calpeptin, raloxi-\nfene,  and  progesterone.  We  will  discuss  the  statins  and  sirolimus  in \ngreater detail below due to their abundant and high-level evidence.\nThe effectiveness of statins is supported by the highest level of evi-\ndence. A systematic review included three cohort studies and one case- \ncontrol study showed that simvastatin can reduce the risk of RCT [40]. A \nnationwide 11-year follow-up study showed that hyperlipidemia alone \nwas an independent risk factor for RCT. Statins use might provide pro-\ntection  against  RCT  in  patients  with  hyperlipidemia  [41].  However, \nsome studies demonstrated that statins are not beneficial to tendinop-\nathy,  and  even  lead  to  tendinopathy.  A  combined  cohort  and  experi-\nmental investigation shown that the use of statins raises the clinical risk \nof  tendinopathy  by  causing  the  release  of  matrix  metalloproteinases \n[42]. A animal study evaluated the biomechanical and histopathological \neffects of statins on the Achilles tendon in rats [43]. The results showed \nthat statins are associated with calcific tendinopathy risk. Overall, the \neffects of statins are controversial.\nConsistent evidence from 1 case series, 2 animal studies, and 1 in \nvitro test indicated the effectiveness of sirolimus. Clinical date indicated \nthat  sirolimus  is  efficient  in  systemic  lupus  erythematosus  induced \ntendinopathy  [44].  Preclinical  studies  have  shown  that  sirolimus  can \nalleviate tendon ossification and reverse tendon aging. In our previous \nstudy, we found that targeted pathological collagen delivery of sustained \nrelease  sirolimus  can  prevent  heterotopic  tendon  ossification  [11]. \nAnother study provided evidence that the intake of sirolimus through \ndiet  effectively  decelerated  or  halted  the  natural  progression  of \nage-related tendon stiffness and the decline in energy storage capability \n[45]. Furthermore, a study shown that sirolimus has a partial inhibitory \neffect  on  senescence-associated  β-gal  activity  and  morphological \nchanges.  This  suggests  that  sirolimus  can  reverse  senescence  in  rat \ntendon stem/progenitor cells at both the molecular and cellular levels \n[46].\nA, Flow diagram for the selection of articles with data of candidate \ndrugs  against  tendinopathy  published  from  2013  up  to  2022.

For studies hy-\npothesizing  that  drugs  aid  in  tendinopathy  treatment,  evidence  was \ncategorized  as  effective  (green)  or  ineffective  (blue);  for  studies  hy-\npothesizing that drugs may cause tendinopathy, evidence was catego-\nrized as harmful (red) or harmless (yellow).\n3.3. Deep learning-based drug efficacy prediction\nIn this section, we conducted a re-evaluation of high-potential drugs \nby integrating drug structure information. Firstly, we constructed and \nvisualized  a  network  depicting  structural  similarities  among  drugs  to \nassess structural diversity. We computed the structural distance matrix \nby utilizing the Dice similarity coefficient to compare all possible pairs \nof  candidate  medicines.  The  hierarchical  clustering  analysis  demon-\nstrated that the input medications exhibited a wide range of chemical \nstructural diversity, as shown in Fig. 5A. Afterwards, we utilized DLEPS \nto evaluate the effectiveness of medicines. DLEPS is a neural network \nthat use linear representation of chemical structures as input to accu-\nrately model transcriptional profiles obtained from the L1000 project. \nThis  enables  researchers  to  make  predictions  on  the  relationship  be-\ntween  chemical  structure  and  transcriptional  features  [17].  DLEPS \nanalysis showed that all eight medications exhibited promising potential \nin alleviating tendinopathy (Fig. 5B). Statins and sirolimus, which are \nranked  high  in  multiplex  transcriptional  prediction  and  supported  by \nabundant literature evidence, continue to perform well in DLEPS.\nA, Drugs structural similarity dendrogram. The candidate drugs are \nthe nodes and the distance between two nodes is an estimate of their \nsimilarity. B, Enrichment scores of drug candidates from DLEPS based on \ntendinopathy gene signatures as the genetic input.\nUsing  MR  to  identify  genetic  evidence  of  drugs  for  tendinopathy \ntreatment.\nWe  further  explored  genetic  evidence  of  statins  and  sirolimus  for \ntendinopathy  treatment  (Fig.  6).  This  study  includes  two  pharmaco-\nlogical  targets as  exposures: mTOR  inhibitors and  HMGCR  inhibitors. \nWe performed a MR analysis using the summary statistics from a Eu-\nropean  population-based  GWAS  dataset.  The  analysis  focused  on \nmTORC1-related proteins in plasma, specifically RP-S6K, EIF4EBP, and \nEIF-4F components. In addition, we suggested a method in which we \nchose certain SNPs within 100 kilobase windows from the HMGCR gene, \nwhich was linked to LDL cholesterol levels at a significant level across \nthe  entire  genome.  This  method  serves  as  a  proxy  for  measuring  the \neffects of statins. GWAS data of RCT was obtained by extracting sum-\nmary statistics from 299,273 individuals in the FinnGen consortium.\nThis  study  utilises  the  connections  of  the  chosen  genetic  tools  to \nrepresent the pharmacological adjustment of the drug’s target protein of \ninterest.  Genetic  variations  originating  from  the  gene  responsible  for \nproducing  the  specific  protein  targeted  by  statins  are  chosen  as  in-\nstruments.  The  main  downstream  effect  of  statins  is  decreased  circu-\nlating  LDL  cholesterol.  Genetic  variants  from  mTORC1  downstream \ntarget proteins of sirolimus are selected as instruments.

When  phosphorylated \nby mTORC1, it separates from EIF-4E and subsequently facilitates the \nformation of the EIF-4F complex. The EIF-4F complex consists of EIF-4E, \nEIF-4G,  and  EIF-4A.  The  outcome  of  MR  is  rotator  cuff  syndrome \nextracted from the FinnGen consortium. The primary MR analysis uti-\nlized inverse variance weighted analysis. The study employed weighted \nmedian and MR Egger regression methods in supplementary analysis.\nA proteome-wide MR approach is employed to ascertain the corre-\nlation between circulating protein levels reliant on mTORC1 and RCT. \nAfter removing SNPs that exhibited linkage disequilibrium, outline, or \npalindromic  sequence,  a  total  of  55  SNPs  were  selected  for  genetic \nprediction of mTORC1 downstream proteins (Supplementary Table 6). \nWe evaluated the potency of SNPs employed as the instrument by uti-\nlizing  the  F-statistic.  To  mitigate  any  potential  bias  from  weak  in-\nstruments, we only considered SNPs with an F-statistic greater than 10 \n[47].  The  results  indicate  that  there  is  evidence  linking  the  higher \nexpression of mTORC1 downstream proteins in blood with an increased \nrisk of RCT in IVW (odds ratio (OR) = 1.03, 95 % confidence interval \n(cid:0) 3), Weighted median (OR = 1.04, \n(CI) = 1.01–1.08; P-value = 1.11 × 10\nCI  = 1.01–1.06;  P-value  = 0.01)  and  MR  Egger  (OR  = 1.05,  CI  =\n(cid:0) 3),  indicating  that  sirolimus  might \n1.01–1.08;  P-value  = 4.11  × 10\nlower the risk of RCT (Fig. 7A–C). In addition, the analyses that excluded \neach  SNP  showed  that  no  one  SNP  was  responsible  for  these  results. \nInstead, the results were indicative of a combined pattern (Fig. 7B). The \nfunnel plot displayed no evidence of heterogeneity (Fig. 7D).\nNext,  we  examined  the  causality  between  HMGCR-mediated  LDL \ncholesterol  levels  and  RCT.  From  the  GWAS  summary  data  of  LDL \ncholesterol levels, a total of 7 SNPs located within or near the HMGCR \ngene were chosen (Supplementary Table 6). There was no notable as-\nsociation  observed  between  the  levels  of  HMGCR-mediated  LDL \ncholesterol and the risk of RCT.

Validating the therapeutic potential of sirolimus target against \nclinical tendinopathy\nThus  far,  sirolimus’s  potential  effectiveness  for  tendinopathy  is \nsupported  by  evidence  from  multiple  levels.  Sirolimus  is  a  highly \neffective drug that suppresses the immune system. It works by attaching \nto FK-binding protein-12 and preventing the activation of the protein \nkinase called mammalian target of sirolimus mycin [48]. In 1999, the US \nFood and Drug Administration granted approval for sirolimus as a means \nto avoid the rejection of solid organ transplants. Since then, over the \ncourse of the previous two decades, sirolimus has been discovered to be \na  medicine  that  is  well-tolerated  by  patients  and  had  an  outstanding \nsafety record [48].\nWe studied the therapeutic efficacy of sirolimus in a tendinopathy \nmodel.

Thirdly,  sirolimus  performed  excellently  in  deep  learning \nbased drug efficacy prediction. Fourthly, genetically predicted plasma \nlevels of downstream proteins inhibited by sirolimus increased tendin-\nopathy risk. Fifthly, after sirolimus treatment, the motor function and \nhistological score of animal models were significantly improved. Sixthly, \nmTOR-TKO  mice  exhibited  enhanced  resistance  to  tendinopathy.  The \nsignificance of our findings is especially relevant for patients suffering \nfrom  calcific  tendinopathy.  Through  integrative  pathway  enrichment \nanalysis, we identified the clinical tendinopathy pathways that can be \nreversed  by  mTOR  inhibition.  A  substantial  enrichment  of  the  bone \nmorphology-related  pathways  indicated  that  sirolimus  may  provide \npotential therapeutic benefits in ameliorating heterotopic ossification in \nclinical tendinopathy.\nDespite the high prevalence and incidence of tendinopathy, effective \nmethods  for  disease  relief  are  currently  lacking.  Severe  tendinopathy \ncan be treated with surgical interventions, but the outcomes are often \nunsatisfactory  [50].  Conventional  drug  treatments  are  limited  to \nsymptomatic relief, with uncertain efficacy [51]. Our results highlight \nthe potential clinical application of currently available FDA-approved \nmTOR inhibitors, which could potentially be repurposed for conserva-\ntive treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy, fundamentally slowing the \nprogression of tendinopathy.\nWe  employed  many  methodologies  to  offer  a  holistic  outlook  on \npharmacological repurposing. Transcriptomics drug prediction is based \non the principle of signature reversion (SRP), which assumes that if a \ntreatment can reverse the expression pattern of genes that are charac-\nteristic of a specific disease phenotype, then it may have the ability to \nreverse the disease phenotype itself [8]. SRP has effectively been utilized \nto discover new possibilities for repurposing drugs across several fields \nof therapy [52–54]. However, the drug-perturbed transcriptomics pro-\nfiles are obtained from cells [55]. This is perhaps the most fundamental \nlimitation in transcriptomics drug prediction, as much of physiology and \npharmacology is non-cell-autonomous. We applied systematic review to \nsupplement the evidence of drugs at the level of tissues and humans. The \nfocused attention on drugs supported by clinical evidence allowed us to \nefficiently  identify  candidate  drugs.  However,  it  inevitably  led  to  the \nomission of certain drugs. MR provides a rapid and affordable approach \nto evaluating causal questions [56]. Genetic variants in MR are used as \ninstrumental variables to examine the possible impact of drug target on \ndisease outcomes in large observational datasets. These variants can be \nseen as proxies for an intervention on the drug target [57]. However, \nthere is a difference between genetic effect and pharmacological effect. \nGenetic variants that represent the effects of drugs are the result of tiny \nchanges in drug targets over a person’s lifetime. This is different from a \npharmacological  intervention  in  later  life,  which  usually  has  a  larger \neffect but for a shorter duration [35]. It is for exactly this reason that MR \nestimates  of  genetically  proxied  drug  effects  are  typically  greater  in \nmagnitude than those observed in clinical practice [58]. Although these \nrestraints make the effectiveness of sirolimus warrants further investi-\ngation, the consistency between findings supports the robustness of our \nconclusions.\nThe goal of systems biology is to comprehend physiology and disease \nfrom  the  level  of  molecules,  pathways,  cells,  tissues,  organs  and  ulti-\nmately the whole organism [10]. Our drug repurposing strategy employs \ndiverse approaches that span multiple levels to adequately consider the \nbiological  complexity  of  tendinopathy.  Three  principal  approaches  in \nsystems biology are plenarily employed in this study: large-scale data \n13 \ngeneration  and  mining;  in  silico  simulation;  and  the  use  of  complex \nbiological systems to assay and model biology [9]. Firstly, the generated \nprofiling data from high-throughput analysis was utilized to: 1) define \nmolecular characteristics of tendinopathy, 2) acquire genetic association \ndata and predict the causal relationship between tendinopathy and drug \ntargets,  and  3)  establish  comprehensive  connections  between  animal \nmodels  and  patients.  Secondly,  complementary  in  silico  simulations \nenabled us to integrate diverse information, leading to a sophisticated \ncandidate drug list. Thirdly, we took biological responses as a corner-\nstone in drug prediction (drug-perturbed transcriptomics profiles from \ncells)  and  drug  verification  (biological  system  recapitulation, \ncross-species integration analysis).\nNevertheless,  this  study  has  some  limitations.  Our  tendinopathy \nsamples were from the rotator cuff, while healthy samples were from the \nAchilles  tendon.  The  ideal  control  for  this  study  would  have  been  a \nmatched number of healthy supraspinatus tendon samples; however, in \nclinical  practice,  opportunities  to  collect  these  samples  without \nimpacting  patient  health  are  extremely  rare.  This  study  conducted  a \nlarge-scale  (n  > 100)  transcriptome  analysis  of  clinical  tendinopathy \npatients, involving only a single-center cohort of RCT patients. There-\nfore, the lack of reliable RNA-seq datasets from other sources limits the \nreproducibility  of  tendinopathy  gene  signatures.  Besides,  we  did  not \nconsider the disease heterogeneity of tendinopathy. Additional investi-\ngation is necessary to examine the clinical characteristics and molecular \nclassifications of patients who may experience positive outcomes from \nsirolimus treatment.\n5. Conclusions\nOur study assimilates knowledge of system-level responses to iden-\ntify  potential  drugs  for  tendinopathy.  Sirolimus,  a  commonly  used \nmTOR inhibitor with a recognized safety profile, has the potential to be \nrepurposed for the treatment of tendinopathy. This could offer a quick \nroad to clinical application. Drug repositioning based on systems biology \nidentifies and targets biologically significant pathways that are essential \nand  can  be  effectively  addressed  with  pharmacological  interventions. \nWe have presented a approach for the repositioning of medications and \nthe development of therapies that are tailored to specific diseases based \non their characteristics.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nZetao Wang: Writing – original draft, Resources, Methodology, Data \ncuration,  Conceptualization.
