### Search Overview  
Our search on PubMed identified two relevant Mendelian Randomization (MR) studies:

1. Zetao Wang et al. (2025) "Sirolimus as a repurposed drug for tendinopathy: A systems biology approach combining computational and experimental methods"
2. Cheng Tan et al. (2023) "mTORC1-Dependent Protein and Parkinson’s Disease: A Mendelian Randomization Study"

Both studies utilized MR methods, focusing on the effects of rapamycin but targeting different health conditions.

### Data Sources for Instrument Selection  
- **Wang et al. (2025):** Utilized genetic data from the FinnGen Consortium, Global Lipids Genetics Consortium, and The INTERVAL study. This combination of datasets offers a broad and diverse genetic basis for instrument selection.
- **Cheng Tan et al. (2023):** Relied on data from the INTERVAL study and the International Parkinson’s Disease Genomics Consortium. By sourcing disease-specific data, this study ensures relevance to Parkinson's Disease.
  
Both studies used the INTERVAL study as a common data source but differed in their additional datasets, relying on distinct consortia for more tailored genetic instruments pertinent to their respective conditions.

### Differences in QTL Targets  
- **Wang et al. (2025):** Focused on the molecular target, Rapamycin, evaluating its therapeutic potential in tendinopathy. The inclusion of both transcriptomics and proteomics data enriches the understanding of molecular interactions and pathways.
- **Cheng Tan et al. (2023):** Investigated mTORC1-associated proteins concerning Parkinson’s Disease, specifically targeting Rapamycin. However, it did not utilize omics data, which might limit the depth of molecular mechanism exploration.
  
These differences illustrate a broader approach by Wang et al. (2025) utilizing multi-omics datasets, potentially offering a more comprehensive molecular context compared to the singular focus of Cheng Tan et al. (2023).

### SNP Selection Criteria and LD Clumping Thresholds  
- **Wang et al. (2025):** Employed a more lenient p-value threshold of 0.05 and an LD clumping threshold of r² = 0.30. This approach likely included a larger number of SNPs but with the risk of incorporating less robust associations.
- **Cheng Tan et al. (2023):** Applied a stringent p-value threshold of 5e-06 and an LD clumping threshold of r² = 0.05. This methodological rigor ensures strong, independent genetic associations but may also exclude some potentially relevant SNPs.

### Pleiotropy Checks and Sensitivity Analyses  
- **Wang et al. (2025):** Conducted standard pleiotropy checks and sensitivity analyses but did not specify using advanced methods like MR-Egger or MR-PRESSO.
- **Cheng Tan et al. (2023):** Implemented a comprehensive range of pleiotropy and robustness checks, including MR-Egger, Cochran’s Q, and MR-PRESSO. These additional analyses enhance the reliability and robustness of the causal inference.

### Final Assessment of Study Quality and Reliability  
- **Wang et al. (2025):** Demonstrates moderate methodological rigor but could benefit from more stringent SNP selection and comprehensive pleiotropy assessments.
- **Cheng Tan et al. (2023):** Exhibits high methodological rigor through stringent SNP selection criteria and extensive pleiotropy and sensitivity analyses.

Given the methodological rigor and comprehensive approach to robustness checks, **Cheng Tan et al. (2023)** stands out as the stronger study. It is recommended as a benchmark for ensuring methodological robustness, especially in future MR studies focusing on complex diseases. While **Wang et al. (2025)** is valuable for its broad data sources and system biology approach, it highlights the importance of stringent SNP selection and pleiotropy assessments in MR research.
