Cai et al. / Causal Association Between mTOR-Dependent Protein Levels\nINTRODUCTION\nAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is a typical neurode-\ngenerative disease characterized by morbidity and\ncognitive impairment in elderly people [1]. It makes\nup 60%–80% of all dementia cases [1], affecting over\n50 million people worldwide [2]. Given the high\nprevalence and heavy economic burden, exploring\nmore detailed pathogenesis to help reduce the risk of\nAD is urgently required [3]. Amyloid-(cid:2) (A(cid:2)) pep-\ntide and neuroﬁbrillary tangles (NFTs) formed by\nhyperphosphorylated tau have been regarded as the\nmajor pathological markers of AD [4]. These pro-\ntein affect dendritic integrity and lead to the death of\nnerve cells by interrupting the connections between\nnerve cells [4, 5]. Various targets and pathways par-\nticipate and stimulate the composition of A(cid:2) and\ntau, including the mammalian target of rapamycin\n(mTOR) signaling-related pathway [6].\nmTOR, an atypical serine/threonine protein kinase,\nregulates several essential mammalian cell functions\n[7]. The mTOR signaling pathway has been repeat-\nedly reported to participate in nervous system disease,\nespecially AD. Additionally, mTOR complexes exist\nin two main multiprotein complexes, mTOR complex\n1 and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC1 and mTORC2)\n[8] (Fig. 1). Both the upstream regulation and down-\nstream outputs of mTORC1 are being more studied\nand well discussed compared with mTORC2 in AD\n[9]. Importantly, mTORC1 was more activated in the\nAD brains instead of mTORC2 by detecting levels\nof mTOR/p-mTOR and its downstream targets in\nautopsied brain hippocampal tissues obtained from\nAD patients [10]. Our study mainly focuses on the\nupstream and downstream targets of mTORC1 for\nthe reason that they can contribute to messenger RNA\ntranslation and protein synthesis of A(cid:2) and tau [7].\nNumerous studies have made the relationships\nbetween upstream and downstream targets of mTOR\nand their interaction relatively straightforward [11].\nmTORC1 is activated by growth factors, energy\nmetabolism, nutrients and stress [12]. The phospho-\ninositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/ protein kinase B (AKT)\npathway plays a vital role in transmitting growth fac-\ntors (Insulin, IGF) signals to mTORC1 by regulating\nthe phosphorylation of TSC1/2. The downstream tar-\ngets of mTORC1 are unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1),\ntranscription factor EB (TFEB), ribosomal protein\nS6 kinases (RP-S6K), and eukaryotic translation ini-\ntiation factor 4E-binding protein (EIF4E-BPs). The\nformer two are crucial protein for autophagy. ULK1\nis a crucial part of the macroautophagy initiation\ncomplex. TFEB regulates the expression of lysoso-\nmal biogenesis and autophagy. Activating mTORC1\ncan restrain autophagy by phosphorylating ULK1 and\nTFEB [13]. The latter two play essential roles in the\nregulation of translation, which will be primarily dis-\ncussed in this study. The activated mTORC1 activates\nRP-S6K, further controls cell growth via promot-\ning ribosome biogenesis, and activating several key\nfactors in translation [14]. EIF4E-BPs, composed of\nEIF4E-BP1, 2, and 3, isolate eukaryotic translation\ninitiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and prevent assembling\neIF4F complex, further inhibiting translation initia-\ntion and protein synthesis [15]. Only when mTORC1\ninhibits EIF4E-BPs and then dissociated eIF4E com-\nbines with eIF4G and eIF4A to assemble the eIF4F\ncomplex can it mediates the recruitment of ribosomes\nto mRNA during translation [16]. Accordingly, the\nactivated mTOR leads to the activation of RP-S6K\nand inhibition of EIF4E-BP, resulting in protein syn-\nthesis (Fig. 1).\nAt present, the causal associations between mTOR\nand AD are still debated. Hence, our study focuses\non exploring the causal association of mTOR path-\nways with AD through an approach called Mendelian\nrandomization (MR) because randomized controlled\ntrials and observational studies are difﬁcult to estab-\nlish and prone to confounding, reverse causation, and\nvarious biases [17]. MR is a valuable and efﬁcient\nway to detect unbiased causal effects [17]. A valid\napproach is to choose SNPs as instrumental variables\n(IVs) to mimic the randomized allocation of individ-\nuals to the exposure and thus, ensure comparability\nof groups any confounder. Besides, genetic variants\nof exposure are not subject to reverse causation as\nthey are randomly allocated [18].\nIn this study, we investigated the six target levels of\nmTORC1 (AKT, RP-S6K EIF4E-BP, eIF4E, eIF4A,\nand eIF4G) using the MR approach to explore the\ncausal relationships between these protein and AD.\nMETHODS\nGenetic predictors of plasma RP-S6K,\nEIF4E-BP, eIF4E, eIF4A, and eIF4G\nGenetic predictors of the data about mTOR-\nrelated gene exposure were retrieved from a recent\ngenome-wide association study (GWAS) of results\nof the human plasma proteome from the INTER-\nVAL study with 3301 healthy individuals of European\ndescent (mean age 43.7 years, 48.9% females) [19]\n(Supplementary Table 1).

Upstream and downstream regulations of mTOR and the function with AD. Both mTORC1 and mTORC2 are activated by growth\nfactor and PI3K-dependent signaling. PI3K/AKT activates mTORC1 via inhibitory phosphorylation of TSC1/2. AKT serves as an essential\nconnecting node, activating mTORC1 through PI3K signaling or downstream of mTORC2 activation. mTORC1 is hyperactive in AD in most\nprevious studies, further inhibits autophagy initiation, and promotes ribosome biogenesis and mRNA translation through phosphorylation\nof the ULK, TFEB, RP-S6Ks, and EIF4E-BPs, respectively.

The genetic associations with AD were\nmeasured in 63926 individuals gathered from 46\ncase-control cohorts in the discovery sample, which\nconsisted of 21,982 clinically diagnosed cases (mean\nage 72.9, 61.3% females) and 41,944 cognitively\nnormal controls (mean age 72.4, 57.1% females)\n(Supplementary Table 1). The cases were conﬁned to\nLOAD (onset at 65 years of age or older) as diagnosed\nby clinical assessment, MRI- or autopsy-conﬁrmed,\nand diagnoses from health care records.\nSelection of instrumental variables\nIn our MR analysis, IVs need to meet three critical\nassumptions: 1) SNPs of mTOR were strongly associ-\nated with AD; 2) SNPs of mTOR were independent\nof the confounders of mTOR and AD; 3) SNPs of\nmTOR were related to AD only via mTOR [17, 22].\nWe used all SNPs independently (r2 < 0.001) and\nsigniﬁcantly (p < 5 × 10–6) predicting an exposure.\nF statistics were utilized to assure the strength of\nthe SNPs [23]. If the F statistic was greater than 10,\nthe SNPs selected were regarded as valid IVs, and\nresults based on those ought not to suffer consid-\nerably from weak IVs [22]. Only the SNPs whose\nF statistics were more than 10 would be remained.\nThe process of selection of IVs was presented in\nFig. 2. Besides, to guarantee meeting the three basic\nassumptions above, we also analyzed in PhenoScan-\nner (http://www.phenoscanner.medschl.cam.ac.uk/),\na database involving comprehensive information on\nthe connection of genotype and phenotype, to identify\nwhether these SNPs were related with the possible"},{"page":4,"text":"1480\nH.-Y.

Firstly, we conducted Cochran’s Q test to\ncheck the heterogeneity representing potential hor-\nizontal pleiotropy [31]. This was a weighted sum\nof the squared distances of the variant-speciﬁc esti-\nmates from the overall IVW estimate. Additionally,\nwe implemented MR-Egger regression to detect and\ndetermine whether there remained some violations\nof the standard IVs assumptions [32]. Moreover,\nthe intercept obtained from the MR-Egger regres-\nsion can be an indicator for assessing directional\npleiotropy, which could inﬂuence causal estimates\n[33]. Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESid-\nual Sum and Outlier methods (MR-PRESSO) were\nused to detect and correct directional pleiotropy [34].\nThe leave-one-out analysis evaluated the effect of\noutlying and pleiotropic genetic variants [33].\nGiven the 6 MR estimates, a Bonferroni-corrected\np-value below 0.008 (0.05/6) was considered signiﬁ-\ncant, and p < 0.05 was regarded nominally signiﬁcant.\nResults were presented in odd ratios (ORs) and 95%\nconﬁdence intervals (CIs) per genetically predicted\nstandard deviation (1-SD) unit increase in each tar-\nget. As this study was based on publicly available\nsummary data, no ethical approval is must-have.\nRESULTS\nWe included six upstream and downstream tar-\ngets of mTOR in our MR analysis. After selection\nand quality control, the numbers of IVs of each tar-\nget (AKT, RP-S6K, EIF4E-BP, eIF4E, eIF4A, and\neIF4G) for our MR analyses were 10, 11, 7, 11, 7, and\n7 respectively (Fig. 2). All harmonized IVs with their\ncharacteristics associated with mTOR-related targets\nand AD were listed in Supplementary Tables 2, 3,\n4, 5, 6, and 7. The ORs and 95%CI were shown in\nFig. 3.

We investigated how mTOR inﬂuences the\nabnormal development of A(cid:2) oligomers, tau pro-\ntein phosphorylation, and nervous inﬂammation in\nAD patients. In most studies, abnormally upregulated\nmTOR signaling in AD can drive the synthesis of\nA(cid:2) and tau, decreasing the clearance of these pro-\ntein [11]. Meanwhile, it is indicated that elevated A(cid:2)\ndeposits, in turn, hyperactivate mTOR, which hyper-\nphosphorylated tau, forming NFTs [36]. A(cid:2) deposits\nand NFTs lead to nerve inﬂammation and further\nblood-brain barrier impairment, where mTOR sig-\nnaling also acts as an essential factor [37, 38].\nUpper regulators like PI3K/AKT signaling axis\nplay a crucial role in AD patients. We found that\nAKT could lower the risk of AD, which was\nconsistent with previous studies. In some experi-\nments, PI3K/AKT is involved in many signaling\npathways delaying the progression of AD, such as\nPI3K/Akt/Nrf2/HO-1 [39], PI3K/Akt/GSK-3 (cid:2) [40],\nand PI3K/AKT/FoxO3a [41]. Via PI3K/AKT signal-\ning axis, these experiments reduced oxidative stress,\nneurodegeneration, neuroinﬂammation and cognitive\nimpairment in AD mouse/mice. Accordingly, AKT\ncan be regarded as one of the treatment targets for\nAD.\nIn our study, AD would be at a lower risk with\nhigher levels of RP-S6K. Chiku et al. knocked down\nS6K of Drosophila homolog and found that the\nlevel of pSer262-tau increased. Their study indicated\nthat activation of S6K signiﬁcantly decreased the\nlevels of toxic tau and acted as a protective role\nin suppressing neurodegeneration [42]. However, in\nterms of previous mainstream studies, it seemed to\nincrease the risk of AD. It has been reported that\nover-activating mTORC1 in AD activates RP-S6K,\nwhich upregulates excessive tau mRNA translation"},{"page":7,"text":"H.-Y. Cai et al. / Causal Association Between mTOR-Dependent Protein Levels\n1483\n[43]. Examination of brain tissue from AD patients\nrevealed that phosphorylated S6K was associated\nwith increased tau protein [44]. No matter how RP-\nS6K inﬂuences the development of AD, we conﬁrm\nthat RP-S6K is genetically related to the risk of AD.\nAs mentioned earlier, EIF4E-BP and its down-\nstream targets, involving eIF4E, eIF4A, and eIF4G,\nare essential indicators of mTORC1. We discovered\na causal relationship between eIF4E and the risk\nfor AD, though no causal associations of EIF4E-\nBP, eIF4G, and eIF4A were observed in AD. We\nfound that eIF4E played a risk factor in the develop-\nment of AD, which was in line with previous studies\nabout the hypothesis of over-activation of mTOR. The\nmTOR signaling stimulates 4EBP1 phosphorylation\nand then leads to the formation of the eIF4F complex\n[45], which is positively correlated with total tau and\np-tau [46].\nMR is a relatively superior and convenient method\nfor exploring the understanding of cause-and-effect\nrelationships between disease and molecule targets,\nproviding a probable reference for clinical trials. As\nwe know, rapamycin, a mTORC1 inhibitor, is rela-\ntively well established in animal studies and proved\neffective for patients at the early age of AD. A phase I\nstudy of rapamycin is on the go (NCT042009). Sev-\neral previous studies have reported that rapamycin\nand other methods of inhibiting mTORC1 effectively\nimprove AD in different well-established mouse\nmodels of AD by reducing A(cid:2) levels [47], inhibit-\ning the abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein [48],\nrestoring brain functions for asymptomatic APOE4\ncarriers [49], clearing chronic nervous inﬂammation\n[50], and breaking the negative feedback mech-\nanism on insulin signaling to improve synaptic\nprotein synthesis [51]. As we found, these three\nmTOR-dependent circulating proteins (AKT, RP-\nS6K, eIF4E) have causal effects on AD, arguably\nsupporting the approach to AD therapy using mTOR\nas a therapeutic target.\nThe current study still had several limitations. First,\nthe GWAS dataset of EIF4E-BP mainly concerns 4E-\nBP2 because 4E-BP1-related GWAS data were not\nfound. Most related studies were conducted with 4E-\nBP1, although 4E-BP2 could be the most abundant\nisoform. For example, 4E-BP2 was the most plentiful\nin the brain [14]. This was one of our most signiﬁ-\ncant limitations. Secondly, this study was based on\ngenetic predictors of upstream and downstream pro-\ntein of mTOR whose correspondence with biological\nmarkers of AD. Given that the GWAS datasets about\nA(cid:2) and tau are hard to obtain, we did not analyze\nMR between pathological features of AD and mTOR-\ndependent protein levels. Thirdly, in spite of age\nhaving been adjusted in the original GWAS datasets\npapers [19, 21], the case of AD in IGAP is an older age\ngroup, which could cause selection bias [52]. Finally,\nbecause there were only a few SNPs selected through\nthe conventional GWAS threshold (p < 5×10–8), we\nrelaxed the threshold (p < 5×10–6) to obtain more IVs\nto perform MR analysis, as portrayed in other mTOR\nMR studies [53].\nConclusions\nAlthough further studies are needed to discover\nthe detailed role of mTOR signaling-related targets in\nAD, our ﬁndings support a shared genetic background\nbetween mTOR signaling-related targets and the risk\nfor AD. Activating AKT and RP-S6K, or inhibiting\neIF4E may be potentially beneﬁcial to the prevention\nand treatment of AD.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank the investigators of the original\nstudies [19, 21] for sharing the Proteomics-GWAS\ndata from Sun et al., AD GWAS data used in this\nstudy, and the IGAP for providing summary results\ndata for these analyses.
