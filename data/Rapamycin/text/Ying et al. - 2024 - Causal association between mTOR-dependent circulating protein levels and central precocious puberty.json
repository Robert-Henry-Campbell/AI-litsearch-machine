In Denmark, a\nstatistic based on a registered population showed that the\nprevalence of precocious puberty was about 0.2% in girls and less\nthan 0.05% in boys (3). Notably, precocious puberty can affect adult\nheight and increase the risk of behavioral and psychological\nproblems, cancer, obesity, cardiovascular disease and type 2\ndiabetes (4–8). Therefore, the prevention of precocious puberty is\nparticularly important in global public health.\nThe mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/\nthreonine protein kinase in the PI3K-related protein kinase\n(PIKK) family and participates in the composition of two protein\ncomplexes named mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR\ncomplex 2 (mTORC2) (9). mTORC1 performs essential functions\nin the regulation of cellular anabolism and catabolism, such as\nlipids and nucleotides,\npromoting the synthesis of proteins,\nmaintaining energy homeostasis, and inhibiting catabolism and\nautophagy (9). In terms of protein synthesis, mTORC1\nphosphorylates two key effectors downstream named eukaryotic\ntranslation initiation factor 4E binding protein (eIF4EBP) and\nribosomal protein S6K kinase 1 (S6K1) to promote translation\n(10). Wherein phosphorylated eIF4EBP enhances 5′ cap-dependent\nmRNA translation by releasing eukaryotic translation initiation\nfactor 4E (eIF4E) and promoting its formation of eukaryotic\ntranslation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) with eukaryotic translation\ninitiation factor 4A (eIF4A) and eukaryotic translation initiation\nfactor 4G (eIF4G) (11). As for mTORC2, it regulates a variety of\ncellular structures and functions such as cytoskeleton, metabolism,\nproliferation and survival by phosphorylating members of the AGC\n(PKA/PKG/PKC) family of protein kinases including protein kinase\nC-alpha (PKC-a), serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein\nkinase 1 (SGK1) and Akt (9, 12–14).\nPrevious studies have found that the mTOR signaling pathway\nhas a signiﬁcant effect on CPP. Activation of the IGF-1/Akt/mTOR\npathway in the hypothalamus of prepubertal female rats increases\nthe expression of kisspeptin protein (encoded by the Kiss-1 gene)\nand gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), resulting in an\nearlier puberty in female rats (15, 16). In contrast, inhibition of\nmTOR in the hypothalamus blocks the activation of Kiss-1, G-\nprotein-coupled receptor GPR54 (also named Kiss1R) and GnRH\n(15). However, due to the lack of exploration of the relationship\nbetween downstream proteins in the mTOR signaling pathway and\nCPP in previous studies, the relationship between mTOR-\ndependent downstream proteins and CPP is currently inconclusive.\nMendelian randomization (MR) is an approach of genetic\nepidemiology that uses genetic variants, known as single\nnucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as proxies for exposures of\ninterest to explore causal relationships between exposures and\noutcomes (17). The advantages of MR lie in the fact that it\nminimizes confounders, bias, and reverse causation associated\nwith observational studies, and is consistent with the principle of\nrandomization in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (17). Given\nthe important role of the mTOR signaling pathway in CPP, in the\npresent study, we explored the effects of mTOR-dependent\ncirculating protein (Akt, eIF4A, eIF4E, eIF4EBP, eIF4G, PKC-a\nand S6K1) levels on CPP using two-sample MR.\n2 Materials and methods\n2.1 Study design and MR assumptions\nThe process of this study was carried out in strict accordance\nwith the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in\nEpidemiology Using Mendelian Randomization (STROBE-MR)\nStatement (18). The ﬂow chart (Figure 1) shows the general\ndesign of this study.\nThere are three assumptions that must be met in MR studies\n(Figure 2): (i) Genetic variants used to proxy exposure must be\nclosely correlated with the exposure; (ii) Genetic variants are not\nassociated with any confounders that affect the exposure-outcome\nrelationship; (iii) Genetic variants can only impact outcomes via the\ntarget exposure. The rationale for the ability of MR studies to reduce\nbias is that genetic variants are randomly arranged and ﬁxed at the\ntime of conception, and are therefore largely unaffected by\nconfounding factors and are not altered by disease progression.\n2.2 Data sources for exposure\nand outcome\nThe genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets of\nmTOR-dependent circulating protein levels in the discovery\ncohort were retrieved from a publicly available proteomics-\nGWAS INTEVAL study, which enrolled 3,301 participants of\nEuropean ancestry and measured data on 3,600 proteins (19).\nThe cis-eQTLs of corresponding genes of the mTOR-dependent\ncirculating proteins in the validation cohort were retrieved from\neQTLGen Consortium (20). The GWAS dataset of CPP outcome\nincluding 171 cases and 361,988 controls of European ancestry were\nretrieved from the FinnGen Consortium (R9) (21).\n2.3 Selection of instrumental variables\nThe IVs for exposure in the discovery cohort were screened for\nthe following conditions: (i) p < 5×10-6; (ii) linkage disequilibrium\n(LD) clumping (r2 < 0.001, threshold 10,000kb). The IVs for exposure\nin the validation cohort were screened for the following conditions:\n(i) p < 5×10-8; (ii) ± 250kb of the gene location; (iii) weak LD (r2 < 0.2,\nthreshold 150 kb) to clump extracted cis-eQTLs in order to maximize\nthe strength of the instrument for each gene. Meanwhile, all IVs in the\ndiscovery and validation cohorts need to meet F statistics (beta2/se2)\n(22, 23) > 10 in order to minimize weak instrumentation bias (24).\nMoreover, we assessed whether SNPs in screened IVs were associated\nwith known risk factors of CPP by the PhenoScanner V2 database\n(http://www.phenoscanner.medschl.cam.ac.uk/).

Finally, when\nharmonizing the data of exposure and outcome, we removed all\npalindromic SNPs.\n2.4 Statistical analyses\nEgger (27) and weighted median (WM) (28) were used as\ncomplementary methods to verify the robustness of the results.\nMR-Egger regression provides MR estimates after adjustment for\nhorizontal pleiotropy (27). When more than half of the information\ncomes from valid instrumental variables, the WM approach produces\nestimates that are consistent with the actual effects (28). In this study,\nthe results of IVW method were used as a criterion for determining\nwhether there was a causal relationship or not, based on the premise\nthat the results of all three methods had a consistent direction.\nThe Inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was considered as\nthe primary method for determining the causal relationship between\nexposure and outcome in this study, which is found to be more\nreliable in the absence of pleiotropy of IVs (26). Meanwhile, MR-\nIn addition, several sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess\nthe pleiotropy, heterogeneity and robustness of the analyses. First,\nthe Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and\nOutlier (MR-PRESSO) (29) and the intercept test of MR-Egger\nFIGURE 2\nThree core assumptions of Mendelian randomization.\nFrontiers in Endocrinology\n03\nfrontiersin.org"},{"page":4,"text":"Ying et al.\n10.3389/fendo.2024.1360043\n(27) were applied to detect the horizontal pleiotropy, with p < 0.05\nindicating the presence of horizontal pleiotropy. Second, the\nCochrane Q test was applied to detect heterogeneity between\ngenetic variants for the IVW and MR-Egger methods, where p <\n0.05 indicated the presence of heterogeneity (30). Third, we visually\nassessed the heterogeneity among SNPs through the funnel plot.\nFourth, we also performed leave-one-out sensitivity analyses to\nassess whether the results remained stable after excluding a\nparticular SNP. Finally, we replicate the positive results from the\ndiscovery cohort in the validation cohort to demonstrate the\nrobustness of the results.\nAll statistics were two-tailed, and p value < 0.05 was taken as\nstrong evidence for the existence of a signiﬁcant causal relationship.\nAll statistical analyses were conducted using R version 4.3.1.\n3 Results\n3.1 Genetic instruments selection\nAfter rigorous screening, the numbers of eligible SNPs as IVs\nfor mTOR-dependent circulating protein levels were as follows in\nthe discovery cohort: 14 for Akt, 8 for eIF4A, 13 for eIF4E, 10 for\neIF4EBP, 7 for eIF4G, 8 for PKC-a and 11 for S6K1. In the\nvalidation cohort, 1, 3 and 13 eligible SNPs were selected as IVs\nfor eIF4G1, eIF4G2 and eIF4G3. Detailed information of all IVs is\ndisplayed in Supplementary Tables 1A, B. Supplementary Table 2\nshows the strongly correlated phenotypic features corresponding to\nall SNPs used as IVs, none of which were excluded due to\ncorrelation with confounders of CPP.\n3.2 Effect of mTOR-dependent circulating\nprotein levels on CPP\nThe MR results of the effects of seven mTOR-dependent\ncirculating protein levels on CPP are summarized in Figure 3;\nSupplementary Table 3. Speciﬁcally, we found a signiﬁcant causal\nrelationship between the level of eIF4G in plasma and CPP. For\nevery increase of the level of eIF4G in plasma by one standard\ndeviation, the risk of CPP was reduced by 55% (IVW: OR = 0.45,\n95% CI = 0.22–0.91, p = 0.026). However, no signiﬁcant causality\nwas found between the remaining six mTOR-dependent circulating\nprotein levels and CPP.\nTo verify the robustness of the above positive ﬁndings, we\nfurther explored the association between the levels of gene eIF4G in\nthe blood and CPP. Protein eIF4G has three isoforms, named\neIF4G1, eIF4G2 and eIF4G3, which are encoded by the genes\neIF4G1, eIF4G2 and eIF4G3. The MR results of the effects of\ngene eIF4G levels in the blood on CPP are summarized in\nFigure 4; Supplementary Table 4. It was found that there was a\nsigniﬁcant causal relationship between the total level of gene eIF4G\nin the blood as well as the level of gene eIF4G3 and CPP. For every\nincrease of the total level of gene eIF4G and the level of gene eIF4G3\nin the blood by one standard deviation, the risk of CPP was reduced\nby 55% (IVW: OR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.24–0.85, p = 0.014) and 68%\n(IVW: OR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.16–0.63, p = 0.001), respectively.\nWhile no signiﬁcant causality was found between the level of gene\neIF4G1 in the blood as well as eIF4G2 and CPP. Such results were\nconsistent with the discovery cohort, and furthermore, it was\nidentiﬁed that it was gene eIF4G3 that played a major role in\npreventing CPP.\nFIGURE 3\nThe MR results of the effects of seven mTOR-dependent circulating protein levels on CPP.\nFrontiers in Endocrinology\n04\nfrontiersin.org"},{"page":5,"text":"Ying et al.\n10.3389/fendo.2024.1360043\nFIGURE 4\nThe MR results of the effects of gene eIF4G levels in the blood on CPP.\n3.3 Sensitivity analysis\nThe results of MR-PRESSO, intercept test of MR-Egger and the\nCochrane Q test in the discovery and validation cohorts are\npresented in Supplementary Table 3, Supplementary Table 4,\nrespectively. It was conﬁrmed by MR-PRESSO and intercept test\nof MR-Egger results (p > 0.05) that there was no horizontal\npleiotropy in all analyses of this study. Meanwhile, all the\nCochrane Q test results were negative (p > 0.05) and no\nsig niﬁcant asymmetry was found in the funnel plot\n(Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 2), which\nsuggested that there was no signiﬁcant heterogeneity among the\nSNPs used as IVs in this study. Finally, as demonstrated by the\nresults of the leave-one-out analysis (Supplementary Figure 3,\nSupplementary Figure 4), none of the SNPs signiﬁcantly affected\nthe causality between the positive exposures (the level of circulating\nprotein eIF4G, the total level of gene eIF4G in the blood and the\nlevel of gene eIF4G3 in the blood) and CPP, which further validated\nthe robustness of the results.\n4 Discussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to assess the causal\nrelationship between mTOR-dependent circulating protein levels\nand CPP using MR method. This MR study provided strong\nevidence of a signiﬁcant negative correlation between mTOR-\ndependent circulating protein eIF4G level and the risk of CPP.\nHowever, there was no evidence of a causal relationship between the\nlevels of the remaining mTOR-dependent circulating proteins (Akt,\neIF4A, eIF4E, eIF4EBP, PKC-a and S6K1) and CPP.\nPremature activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal\naxis is the key to CPP, behind which the leptin-mTOR-Kisspeptin\npathway serves as one of the crucial pathogenic mechanisms (31).\nIn addition to suppressing appetite and increasing energy\nexpenditure, leptin has also been implicated as a permissive factor\nin the activation of GnRH neurosecretion during puberty (32).\nMeanwhile, Kisspeptin is a key activator of gonadotropin secretion\nbecause it induces GnRH secretion by activating GnRH neurons via\ndirect synaptic contact or indirect trans-synaptic inputs (33, 34).\nRoa et al. found that inhibition of central mTOR by rapamycin\nattenuates the permissive effect of leptin on the onset of puberty in\nfood-restricted female rats, while pharmacological inhibition of\nmTOR results in a signiﬁcant decrease in hypothalamic Kiss-1\nexpression (35). Therefore, mTOR acts as an energy sensor in this\npathway, however, the speciﬁc molecular basis of this pathway\nremains unclear (31).\nZhou et al. found that phthalate exposure is associated with an\nincreased incidence of precocious puberty in girls in a case-control\nstudy, and Shao et al. found that Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate\n(DEHP) induces precocious puberty in female rats by\nupregulating the IGF-1/PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway (15).\nSeveral studies have also pointed out (including a RCT study) that\nthe PI3K/Akt signaling pathway or Akt1 is a key target for the\nprevention or treatment of precocious puberty (36–40). However,\nno signiﬁcant causality between Akt levels in plasma and CPP was\nfound in our study. Such differences may arise from the different\ntissues examined (hypothalamus, serum, plasma or testis) as well as\nthe fact that our study did not obtain GWAS data on the levels of\ndifferent Akt isoforms in plasma, instead we explored the total levels\nof Akt in plasma. Two previous studies observed reduced levels of\nPKC expression in the hypothalamus of precocious puberty rats and\nin the hypothalamic GT1-7 neurons of mice after treatment with\ngut microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and the\ntraditional Chinese medicine Fuyou formula, respectively (41, 42).\nIn our study, we did not ﬁnd a causal relationship between PKC-a\nlevel in plasma and CPP, which could be attributed to differences\nbetween tissues or species. Roa et al. found that hypothalamic\nphosphorylated S6K1 (pS6K1) and phosphorylated S6 (pS6) are\ndownregulated in rats with central mTOR inhibition by rapamycin,\nwhereas the expression levels of S6K1 and S6 are unchanged (35).\nThis is consistent with our ﬁndings, suggesting that S6K1 levels in\nthe hypothalamus and blood may not be associated with mTOR\npathway-mediated pubertal development or precocious puberty.\nThere have been no clear reports in the past on the relationship\nbetween eIF4A, eIF4E, eIF4EBP as well as eIF4G and CPP.\nFrontiers in Endocrinology\n05\nfrontiersin.org"},{"page":6,"text":"Ying et al.\n10.3389/fendo.2024.1360043\nWe found a causal relationship between eIF4G level in plasma\nand CPP, suggesting that eIF4G may be a target for the prevention or\ntreatment of CPP. Such a relationship may be related to the following\nfacts: First, as one of the components of the eIF4F complex, eIF4G\nbinds to eIF4E, which is separated from eIF4EBP, and functions to\npromote protein synthesis when the mTOR signaling pathway is\nactivated (11). Secondly, Mezey et al. found that leptin increases the\neIF4E-eIF4G complex in the liver of male rats (43). Moreover, Lynch\net al. found that leptin secretion is in turn regulated by the mTOR\nsignaling (phosphorylation of eIF4G, S6K1, rpS6, and eIF4EBP1) in\nvitro and in vivo (44). The onset of puberty involves complex\nmetabolic changes, with increased anabolism being one of the\nmanifestations, and at the same time leptin is one of the critical\nfactors in CPP. Taken together, these evidences suggest a potential\ncomplex relationship between eIF4G and the leptin-mTOR axis as\nwell as CPP. We consider that ﬁrstly eIF4G level in plasma can be\nused as an objective basis for assessing potential disease risk in\nchildren with high risk factors of CPP (lack of exercise, vitamin D\ndeﬁciency, poor sleep quality, exposure to endocrine disruptors and\ninternational adoption). Secondly, the causal relationship between\neIF4G and CPP provides new insights into the potential mechanisms\nof leptin-mTOR signaling pathway in CPP. Thirdly, eIF4G is\npromising as a new target for the prevention or treatment of CPP.\nWe speculate that increasing eIF4G level in plasma can help to\nprevent CPP when prepubertal children experience high risk factors\nof CPP and even help to treat CPP. However, further work is needed\nto reveal the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms. It is crucial to\nclarify the standardized reference values for eIF4G in plasma that\nhave preventive or therapeutic signiﬁcance for CPP, to develop eIF4G\nmodulators that meet therapeutic goals, and to clarify the timing,\nmanner, and dosage of eIF4G modulators through further trials.\nAs an integrator of puberty signals, sex-speciﬁc kisspeptin is a\npotential mechanism for the sexual dimorphism in the onset of\npuberty and incidence of idiopathic CPP in children (45). The\nhypothalamus in females expresses higher levels of kisspeptin than\nin males, while observational research has found that the incidence\nof idiopathic CPP is at least 10-fold higher in females than in males\n(45). Therefore, it is essential to differentiate males from females\nwhen exploring the mechanisms of CPP. However, due to the lack\nof summarized data on CPP across genders in the current studies,\nour study was not able to explore whether the mTOR signaling\npathway or mTOR-dependent circulating proteins are equally\nshared in both males and females by subgroup analysis.\nThere are several strengths in this study. First, we used genetic\ninstruments to proxy mTOR-dependent circulating protein levels,\nwhich minimized bias and confounders. Second, we conducted the\nanalysis in terms of both protein expression levels as well as gene\nexpression levels, which improved the robustness of our conclusions.\nThis study has some limitations at the same time. First, only part of\nmTOR-dependent downstream proteins was included in this study.\nmTOR downstream pathways are extensive and the relationship\nbetween other related proteins and CPP needs to be further explored\nin subsequent studies. Second, the genetic variants in this study all\ncame from blood samples. Despite our attempts to obtain GWAS data\nfor the corresponding proteins in hypothalamic tissues via GTEx\nConsortium, we were ultimately unable to obtain suitable\ninstrumental variables. Third, the eQTLs and GWAS data are\nderived from European population, which makes our conclusions\nlack universality. Fourth, as mentioned above, CPP differs between\nmales and females to some extent, and our study did not involve\nsubgroup analysis of gender or different clinical picture. Fifth, the\nINTEVAL study included only 3,301 participants making it impossible\nto detect as many genome-wide important genetic variants as possible.\nTherefore, we chose the looser threshold p < 5×10-6 in the context of\nbalancing statistical efﬁcacy rather than the commonly used GWAS\nsigniﬁcance level p < 5×10-8. Sixth, the CPP outcome data from\nFinnGen Consortium has a relatively small number of cases and\nlarger data of CPP are needed for further validation in the future.\n5 Conclusion\nThis two-sample MR study supports a causal association\nbetween eIF4G level in plasma and CPP. eIF4G level in plasma\ncan be used as an objective basis for assessing potential disease risk\nin children with high risk factors of CPP. However, whether eIF4G\nis involved in the leptin-mTOR signaling pathway in CPP and\nwhether it can be used for the prevention or treatment of CPP need\nto be explored in further studies.\nData availability statement\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included\nin the article/Supplementary Material.
