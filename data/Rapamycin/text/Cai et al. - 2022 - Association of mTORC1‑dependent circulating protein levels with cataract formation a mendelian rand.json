However, the role of mTORC1 downstream proteins, including ribosomal \nprotein S6K (RP-S6K), eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (EIF4EBP), eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (EIF-4G), \neukaryotic initiation factor 4E (EIF-4E), and eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (EIF-4A), in regulating cataract development \nis still unknown. Herein, we conducted a mendelian randomization (MR) study to understand the function of mTORC1 \nsignaling in the process of cataract development.\nResults  The causal estimate was evaluated with inverse-variance weighted (IVW) estimate, weighted median \nestimator, MR-Egger and MR robust adjusted profile score (MR. RAPS). The single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), \nP<5 × 10− 6 and r2<0.05, were selected to genetically predict the RP-S6K, EIF4EBP, EIF-4E, EIF-4A, and EIF-4G. We \nincluded a total of 26,758 cases and 189,604 controls in this MR study. The study revealed causal association between \ncirculating EIF4EBP (OR 1.09, 95% confidence interval 1.03,1.16, P = 0.004), RP-S6K (OR 1.04, 95% confidence interval \n1.01, 1.08, P = 0.02) and cataract formation with IVW estimate. Whereas after correcting outliers, MR robust adjusted \nprofile score (MR. RAPS) shows consistent result with IVW for EIF4EBP (OR = 1.08, 95%CI:1.05–1.11, P = 0.007). The \nobservation strengthened the confidence in the true causal associations. However, no association was found for \ncirculating EIF-4E (OR 1.03, 95% confidence interval 0.97, 1.09, P = 0.31), EIF-4A (OR 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.98, \n1.07, P = 0.34), and EIF-4G (OR 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.94, 1.01, P = 0.64) levels with cataract formation. No \nevidence of heterogeneity and unbalanced horizontal pleiotropy was detected.\nConclusion  The MR study suggests that EIF4EBP is a high-risk factor for cataract development. There may be a \npotential causal association between the mTORC1/EIF4EBP axis and cataract. This research highlights the potential \nmechanism for cataract development and a genetic target to prevent as well as treat cataracts.\nKeywords  mTOR, EIF4EBP, Circulating, Cataract, Mendelian randomization\n*Correspondence:\nJing Zou\njzou30@csu.edu.cn\n1Eye Center of Xiangya Hospital, Hunan Key Laboratory of \nOphthalmology, Central South University, 410008 Changsha, Hunan, \nChina\n2National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Xiangya \nHospital, Central South University, 410008 Changsha, Hunan, China\n3Jiangxi Clinical Research center for Ophthalmic Disease, Jiangxi Research \nInstitute of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Affiliated Eye Hospital of \nNanchang University, Nanchang, China\n4Hunan Key Laboratory of Medical Genetics, School of Life Sciences, \nCentral South University, Changsha, China\n5The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China\n© The Author(s) 2022.

Although the phacoemulsification application \nis  available  worldwide,  over  12  million  people  are  blind \nbecause of cataract until 2010 [1, 4]. Moreover, no effec-\ntive pharmacological strategy exists to prevent the devel-\nopment  of  cataract.  Several  signaling  molecules  and \npathways  take  part  in  modulating  the  development  of \ncataract,  including  the  mechanistic  target  of  rapamy-\ncin  (mTOR)  [5],  endoplasmic  reticulum  stress[6],  and \nadvanced  glycation  end  products  [7]  et  al.  Of  note,  the \nmTOR  signal  pathway  plays  a  critical  regulating  role  in \nthe  occurrence  and  development  of  cataract  by  regulat-\ning  cellar  processes  such  as  cell  growth,  autophagy,  and \nepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [8–10].\nIn  mammals,  mTOR  can  combine  with  different  pro-\nteins  and  generate  different  complexes,  including  the \nmechanistic  target  of  rapamycin  complex1  (mTORC1) \nand  the  mechanistic  target  of  rapamycin  complex2 \n(mTORC2)  [11].  mTORC1  plays  an  important  role  in \nFig.  1  Main  protein  of  mTORC1  signal  pathway  (mTORC1  is  comprised \nby mTOR, Deptor, mLST8, Raptor, PRAS40. mTORC1 regulates cell function \nalmost  through  phosphorylating  the  downstream  protein  of  mTORC1, \nincluding PR-S6K and EIF4EBP. After getting phosphorylated by mTORC1, \nPR-S6K  activates  EIF-4B,  which  positively  regulates  EIF-4F.  RP-S6K  also \nphosphorylates  and  promotes  the  degradation  of  PDCD4,  which  is  the \ninhibitor of EIF-4B. EIF4EBP is a repressor of EIF-4E, once phosphorylated \nby mTORC1, it dissociate with EIF-4E, and then promotes the assembly of \nEIF-4F  complex. The  EIF-4F  complex  is  composed  by  EIF-4E,  EIF-4G,  and \nEIF-4A. The specificity repressor of mTORC1-rapamycin can combine with \nmTOR, and induce conformational change in mTORC1. RP-S6K, ribosomal \nprotein S6K kinase; EIF4EBP, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein; \nEIF-4G,  translation  initiation  factor  4G;  EIF-4E,  translation  initiation  factor \n4E; EIF-4A, translation initiation factor 4A)\nPage 2 of 11\ncellular senescence and anabolic processes, such as inhib-\niting  autophagy,  inducing  apoptosis,  regulating  trans-\nlational  regulators,  promoting  secreting  or  restraining \nproinflammatory  mediators,  and  displaying  high  meta-\nbolic rate or caloric restriction [5, 12–17]. The regulation \nof  mTORC1  functions  is  primarily  through  phosphory-\nlating the downstream targets, including ribosomal pro-\ntein  S6K  kinase  1  (PR-S6K1)  and  eukaryotic  initiation \nfactor 4E-binding proteins (EIF4EBPs) (Fig. 1) [14]. After \ngetting  phosphorylated,  PR-S6K1  activates  eukaryotic \ninitiation  factor  4B  (EIF-4B),  which  positively  regulates \nthe  5’cap  binging  translation  eukaryotic  initiation  fac-\ntor 4 F (EIF-4 F) [18]. RP-S6K1 also phosphorylates and \npromotes the degradation of PDCD4, which is the inhibi-\ntor  of  EIF-4B  [19].  EIF4EBP  is  a  repressor  of  eukaryotic \ntranslation initiation factor 4E (EIF-4E). Once phosphor-\nylated  by  mTORC1  in  multiple  sites,  it  dissociates  with \nEIF-4E,  then  promotes  the  5’cap-dependent  translation \nand assembling of the EIF-4F complex. The EIF-4F com-\nplex is composed of EIF-4E, EIF-4G, and eukaryotic ini-\ntiation factor 4A (EIF-4A) (Fig. 1) [12].\nRapamycin  binds  with  FKBP12,  a  part  of  mTOR,  and \nforms  a  FKBP12-rapamycin  complex  (Fig.  1).  Subse-\nquently,  the  complex  induces  mTOR  conformational \nchange[20]. mTORC1 is sensitive to the nanomolar con-\ncentration  of  rapamycin  within  one  hour  of  exposure, \nwhereas  mTORC2  requires  a  more  prolonged  exposure \nand  a  higher  dose  [21].  The  change  of  conformation  in \nmTOR causes the disruption between mTOR and Raptor \nin mTORC1 [21]. Meng et al. [8] observed that rapamy-\ncin  can  effectively  impair  EMT  in  lens  epithelial  cells, \nthus inhibiting the process of cataract. At the same time, \nPing  et  al.  [9]  treated  cataract  zebrafish  with  rapamycin \nand discovered the mitigation effect of cataract. Consid-\nering the special role of rapamycin in regulating cataract, \nwe speculated that mTORC1 signaling might affect cata-\nract formation.\nMendelian randomization (MR) is an analytic approach \nfor  assessing  the  causal  association  between  poten-\ntially  modifiable  exposures,  defined  as  single-nucleotide \npolymorphisms  (SNPs),  and  the  clinically  relevant  out-\ncome [22]. Compared with randomized controlled trials \n(RCTs)-the gold standard to establish the causal associa-\ntion, MR utilizes the data from large-scale genome-wide \nassociation  studies  (GWAS).  Thus,  MR  study  is  more \ntime-effective  and  contains  a  larger  sample  size.  More-\nover,  sometimes  RCTs  cannot  be  conducted  as  they  are \ncostly, impartial, and even unethical[23]. In our study, we \nconducted a MR study by leveraging the extensive Euro-\npean population-based GWAS summary statistic data of \nmTORC1-related  protein  in  plasma,  including  the  con-\ncentration  of  RP-S6K,  EIF4EBP,  and  the  EIF-4F  compo-\nnents,  like  EIF-4E,  EIF-4A,  EIF-4G.  In  addition,  we  also"},{"page":3,"text":"Page 3 of 11\nstudied  the  causal  effect  of  mTORC1-related  circulating \nprotein levels on cataract formation.\nthe  reliability  of  MR  results,  we  removed  SNPs  with \npalindromes.\nMethod\nStudy design and participant flowchart\nWe conducted a two-sample MR study that relied on two \ndifferent GWAS summary statistics. For the definition of \nexposures,  we  applied  downstream  targets  of  mTORC1 \nin  plasma,  like  RP-S6K,  EIF4EBP,  and  three  compo-\nnents  of  EIF-4  F,  like  EIF-4E,  EIF-4A,  and  EIF-4G.  We \nalso  obtained  related  SNPs  from  the  proteomics-GWAS \nINTEVAL  study  [24].We  defined  cataract  as  outcome, \nand  for  the  outcome-associated  SNPs,  we  leveraged  the \ndata  from  the  FinnGen  study.  The  flowchart  and  the \nincorporated sample size are shown in Fig. 2.\nEthics\nThis study used published or publicly available summary \ndata that did not involve primary study participants. Eth-\nical  approval  of  each  study  can  be  found  in  the  original \npublications. These studies were conducted with the ethi-\ncal guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki.\nData sources for MR analyses\nData sources for exposure\nThe  genetic  variants  of  mTORC1-dependent  pro-\ntein  in  plasma  were  obtained  from  the  publicly  avail-\nable  proteomics-GWAS  INTEVAL  study  (https://www.\nincluded  3622 \nphpc.cam.ac.uk/ceu/proteins/),  which \nplasma  proteins  from  3301  healthy  volunteers  [24].  The \nINTEVAL  study  lasted  from  mid-2012  to  mid-2014  and \nrecruited blood donors over 18 years old from 25 centers \nof  England’s  National  Health  Service  Blood  and  Trans-\nplant (NHSBT) [25]. The protein concentration was mea-\nsured  by  a  multiplexed,  aptamer-based  approach-Slow \nOff-rate  Modified  Aptamers  (SOMAscan  assay).  This \napproach  helps  analyze  lower  detectable  protein  con-\ncentrations than traditional methods [26, 27]. It uses the \nmodified single standard DNA SOMAmers to bind with \nprotein targets quantified through DNA microarray [28]. \nThe protein abundances were quantified as relative fluo-\nrescent units [24].\nThe  genome-wide  associations  were  obtained  from \nthe  relative  protein  abundances  after  natural  log-trans-\nformed, then adjusted for age, sex, time costing on blood \ncollection, multi-dimensional scale according to popula-\ntion  structural  with  linear  regression,  and  genetic  asso-\nciation[24].  To  obtain  sufficient  SNPs  and  estimate  the \naccurate  result,  we  obtained  genome-wide  significantly \n− 6)  and  independently  (R2<0.05)  SNPs  to  pre-\n(P<5 × 10\ndict  mTORC1-dependent  protein  in  plasma  [29–32], \nincluding RP-S6K, EIF4EBP, EIF-4G, EIF-4E, and EIF-4A, \nfrom the proteomics-GWAS INTEVAL study. To ensure \nData sources for the outcome\nThe  association  of  outcome  relative  SNPs  with  cataract \nwere  obtained  from  the  FinnGen  study  [33]  (https://\nr5.finngen.fi/). This study defined cataract by H25 of the \nInternational  Classification  of  Disease-10  (ICD-10).  The \ngenotype data of the FinnGen research project was from \nFinnish  biobanks  and  digital  health  record  data  from \nFinnish health registries. The 5th data was released in the \nfirst quarter of 2020 with a total sample size of 260,405. \nThe  individuals  with  ambiguous  gender,  high  genotype \nmissingness  (> 5%),  excess  heterozygosity  (± 4SD),  and \nnon-Finnish ancestry were excluded. Finally, 26,758 cases \nand 189,604 controls of Finnish descent were included in \nthis study.\nAssessment of assumptions\nThe MR study fulfilled the three core assumptions (Fig. 2) \n[34]  :(1)  The  IVs  must  be  associated  with  RP-S6K,  EIF-\n4EBP,  EIF-4G,  EIF-4E  and  EIF-4A.  (2)  The  genetic \ninstrument  must  not  be  associated  with  confounders, \nconditional  on  the  exposure-outcome  relationship.  (3) \nThere  should  be  no  association  between  genetic  instru-\nments and cataracts except through EIF-4E, EIF-4A, EIF-\n4G, EIF4EBP, and RP-S6K. We tested assumptions (2) (3) \nby the heterogeneity and pleiotropy test. We tested het-\nerogeneity  with  Cochrane’s  Q  value. The  pleiotropy  was \ndivided  into  vertical  and  horizontal  pleiotropy  accord-\ning to the pathways which SNPs influence the traits[35]. \nConsidering  vertical  pleiotropy  never  violates  the  MR \nassumption  and  does  not  cause  bias[36],  we  only  tested \nthe  horizontal  pleiotropy  with  the  MR  Egger  regression \nintercept and MR-PRESSO.\nSensitivity analysis\nTo  test  and  correct  for  horizontal  pleiotropy  and  examine \nthe robustness of the MR estimates, we applied the value of \nintercept  in  MR-Egger  regression  and  mendelian  random-\nization  pleiotropy  residual  sum  and  outlier  (MR-PRESSO) \n[37].  The  intercept  value  in  the  MR-Egger  regression  was \nequivalent to the magnitude of unbalanced pleiotropic[38]. \nWe also applied the MR-PRESSO to test and correct for the \noutlier  in  the  inverse-variance  weighted  (IVW)  estimate \n[37]. This approach included three components: global test, \noutlier test, and distortion test [37]. MR-PRESSO removes \nSNPs  that  were  questioned  and  refitted  other  SNPs  in  the \nIVW regression, and then estimates the causal effect again \n[37].  The  result  of  the  causal  estimate  is  unbiased  even \nif  outliers  are  up  to  50%  [37].  To  test  for  the  heterogene-\nity, we used Cochrane’s Q value. For the robustness of the \nMR  estimate,  we  applied  the  leave-one-out  approach  to \ntest  whether  any  single  SNPs  drove  the  estimate.

The  SNPs \nwere aligned by the allele letter and frequency. We used \nIVW to obtain the MR estimates. In case of no evidence \nfor horizontal pleiotropy, and weak instruments, the IVW \nwas  used  to  obtain  an  overall  estimate  using  a  formula \nwith  the  meta-analysis  method  of  Wald  estimates.  The \nformula  is  the  ratio  of  the  gene‐outcome  association \nand  the  gene‐exposure  association  of  each  exposure.\n[39] Weight median (WM) estimator[40] and MR-Egger \n[38,  41]  were  used  to  further  analyze  MR  results.  The \nWM estimator provided a consistent estimate when over \n50% of the weight came from valid IVs [40]. Unlike IVW, \nthe  MR-Egger  allows  for  little  evidence  of  a  violation  of \nthe  IV3  assumption  (instrumental  variable  assumption \n3),  which  means  permitting  a  low  degree  of  evidence  of \nthe  pleiotropic  effects  and  still  obtaining  an  unbiased \ncausal  estimate.  However,  it  consumes  statistical  power \n[41]. Therefore, it is generally believed that the results of \nIVW are the most meaningful when passing the sensitiv-\nity analysis [42–44]. Robust Adjusted Profile Score (MR. \nRAPS) was calculated for the causal estimate to provide \nhigher  statistical  power,  despite  the  existence  of  many \nPage 5 of 11\nweak instrumental variables [45]. A circle map was used \nto visualize the result, which combined the MR estimate \nof  all  valid  SNPs  and  the  meta-analysis  of  MR  estimate. \nThe  MR  results  were  described  by  odds  ratio  (OR)  and \nconfidence interval (CI).

However, after correcting out-\nliers,  MR.  RAPS  results  showed  no  significant  causal \nassociation.  Additionally,  MR-Egger  and  weight  median \nshowed no association between the RP-S6K and cataract \n(Table 1).

IVW  showed  that \nEIF4EBP  was  positively  associated  with  cataract,  and \nthe  result  of  MR.  RAPS  was  similar  (Table  1),  which \nstrengthened  the  confidence  of  the  true  causal  associa-\ntions[46].  Meanwhile,  the  association  remained  direc-\ntionally consistent in weight median, whereas MR-Egger \nshowed  no  association  between  mTORC1-dependent \nprotein level of EIF4EBP with cataract (Table 1). All SNPs \ninfluenced by the causal-effect with MR are shown with a \ncircle map (Fig. 3).\nMR estimate of EIF-4G, EIF-4E and EIF-4A\nSimilarly,  we  obtained  14  SNPs  for  EIF-4E,  9  SNPs  for \nEIF-4A,  and  7  SNPs  for  EIF-4G  (Supplementary  Table \n1).  The  EIF-4F  components,  including  EIF-4E,  EIF-4A, \nand  EIF-4G  were  not  associated  with  cataract  (Table 1). \nThe result of MR. RAPS was also similar.

Whereas after correcting the outlier with MR. \nRAPS, we deemed only EIF4EBP causally associated with \ncataract.\nDiscussion\nThis  is  the  first  study  to  assess  the  causal  association  of \nmTORC1-dependent plasma protein levels with cataract \nusing  the  MR  approach.  With  data  from  the  large-scale \nGWAS of Finnish descent, our MR research is concerned \nwith  the  causal  association  between  mTORC1-related \nproteins,  including  RP-S6K,  EIF4EBP,  EIF-4E,  EIF-4A, \nand  EIF-4G  and  cataract.  The  MR  study  suggests  the"},{"page":8,"text":"Page 8 of 11\npositive  direct  association  between  plasma  protein  level \nof EIF4EBP (OR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.03–1.16, P = 0.004) and \nthe risk of cataract in a combined sample of 26,758 cases \nand  189,604  controls.  However,  this  study  provided  no \nevidence  for  the  association  of  genetically  determined \nRP-S6K,  EIF-4E,  EIF-4A,  and  EIF-4G  with  the  onset  of \ncataract. Moreover, sensitivity analyses did not show suf-\nficient  evidence  of  unbalanced  pleiotropy  and  heteroge-\nneity, which indicates the MR estimate was independent \nand robust.\nWith aging, LECs undergo numerous biochemical and \nbiophysical changes, which induces structural and func-\ntional  impairment,  leading  to  EMT  development  and \nautophagy activation[47]. Previous studies have indicated \nthat  mTORC1  possibly  promotes  the  development  of \ncataract through controlling cellular EMT and inhibiting \nthe level of autophagy through related signaling proteins. \nHowever, the involvement of the downstream protein in \nthe mTORC1 signal pathway is not proven. As a critical \nprocess in cataract development, EMT is responsible for \nthe  trans-differentiation  of  lens  epithelial  cells  (LECs) \ninto  mesenchymal  cells.  Its  occurrence  activates  the \nmesenchymal  phenotypes,  which  is  related  to  enhanced \nmigratory  capacity, \nthe  process \nincreases  the  production  of  extracellular  matrix  compo-\nnents [16, 48]. As a result, LECs lose their normal struc-\nture,  transdifferentiate  into  elongated  spindle-shaped \nmyofibroblasts, and migrate across the lens capsule, caus-\ning  cataract  formation  [48].  Zhang  et  al.  [10]  observed \ndecreased  cell  proliferation  and  mobility  upon  specifi-\ncally inhibiting mTOR in LECs with siRNA. Besides, the \nfunction of mTORC1 was decreased, while the EMT level \non LECs was inhibited significantly. Furthermore, Meng \net al. pointed out that activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR \naxis initiates the process of EMT in human lens epithelial \nB-3 cells [49]. The study demonstrated that activation of \nthe  mTOR  pathway  with  the  phosphorylation  EIF4EBP \npromotes the development of cataract, which was consis-\ntent with our results. [49].\ninvasiveness,  and \nOn the other hand, autophagy is an important factor in \nregulating cataract evolution. Autophagy is a highly con-\nserved process that involves the degradation of senescent \nmacromolecules and organelles of LECs to maintain lens \ntransparency [49]. Autophagy is the early response to the \ninternal  environment  disturbance  induced  by  oxidative \nstress, like starvation, hypoxia, deficiency of growth fac-\ntors and over-activation. When encountered with stress, \nautophagy  gets  up-regulated,  making  LECs  adapt  to  a \nnew balance. After achieving homeostasis, the autophagy \nlevel  decreases  [9].  Similarly,  a  previous  study  observed \nthat  amino  acid  deprivation  induces  the  activation  of \nautophagy, and the process is regulated by mTORC1[50]. \nPing  and  collages[9]  reported  that  ablation  of  Gja8b  in \nzebrafish causes severe defects in organelle degradation, \ninducing defective autophagy in LECs and inhibiting the \ndegradation  of  senescent  macromolecules,  leading  to \ncataract  formation.  After  being  treated  with  rapamycin, \nautophagy  was  promoted  in  LECs  in  a  dose-dependent \nmanner  causing  mitigation  of  cataract.  Several  conjec-\ntures exist for regulating proteins related to EIF4EBP and \nmTORC1 to control autophagy. The transcription factor \nFOXO  activates  EIF4EBP  to  active  autophagy/lysosome \nsystem in reducing muscle aging in Drosophila. This sys-\ntem can degrade damaged protein to reduce the accumu-\nlation of metabolic stressors [51].\nExcept autophagy and EMT respective functions in the \nformation  of  cataract,  they  are  also  reported  to  interact \nwith each other. For instance, autophagy induction could \npromote  EMT  in  cardiac  fibrotic  disease  [52],  whereas \nautophagy could contribute to the attenuation of EMT in \nchronic renal fibrosis[53]. Sun et al. [54] discovered that \nautophagy inhibition attenuates the EMT process in New \nZealand  white  rabbit  LECs,  triggered  by  the  TGF-β2/\nSmad signaling pathway. Therefore, part from autophagy \nand  EMT  respective  functions  in  formation  of  cataract, \ntheir interaction may play a critical role in the formation \nprocess of cataract. Therefore, their interactions need to \nbe studied further.\nIn  the  current  study,  we  observed  that  EIF4EBP  was \npositively  associated  with  cataract.  Whereas  RP-S6K, \nEIF-4E, EIF-4G, and EIF-4A were not significantly associ-\nated with cataract. Similar to our study, Zhang et al. [55] \ncompared  RNA  from  age-related  cataracts  and  normal \nlens epithelia using the semiquantitative RT-PCR method \nand observed no difference between cataract and normal \nLECs on EIF-4E levels. We speculate that these proteins \nmay  be  involved  in  other  signaling  pathways.  RP-S6k \nexists in different signal pathways, while S6K/PP1α/B-Raf \ncan activate MAPK in PI3K/AKT signaling in regulating \nprostate cancer cell migration and invasion[56]. Besides, \nthe  EIF-4F  complex  can  also  be  regulated  by  protein, \nexcept  for  the  classical  mTOR  related  molecule,  like \nPDCD4[57]. PDCD4 is a tumor suppressor and can bind \nwith  EIF-4A  to  limit  the  available  content  to  form  EIF-\n4F. EIF-4F components can be regulated apart from EIF-\n4EBP,  promyelocytic  leukemia  protein  (PML)  has  been \nassociated with inhibiting the mRNA nuclear export role \nof  EIF-4E  [58];  EIF4A3  can  combine  with  RNA-binding \nmotif  8A  (RBM8A),  Mago  homolog  (MAGOH),  and \nother auxiliary proteins, and form an exon junction com-\nplex (EJC) to regulate gene expression, including mRNA \nsplicing, translation, and degradation [59]; EIF4G can ini-\ntiate cap-independent translation with the presence of an \ninternal  ribosomal  entry  site  (IRES)  instead  of  depend-\ning  on  cap-binding  protein  eIF4E  [60].  In  conclusion, \naccording  to  this  MR  study,  the  plasma  concentration \nof mTORC1-depended EIF4EBP promotes the onsetting \nof  cataract  on  genetic  level.  Its  regulating  function  may"},{"page":9,"text":"Page 9 of 11\nbe governed through the mTORC1/EIF4EBP axis. How-\never, we speculate that other potential signaling pathways \nmay regulate these proteins and affect the concentration \nof  RP-S6K,  EIF4F  components  in  plasma.  Of  note,  we \ncould  not  detect  the  association  between  cataract  and \nRP-S6K, EIF4F components. Therefore, our study shows \nthat the EIF4EBP is a vital protein associated with cata-\nract. However, further research is required to explore the \nmTORC1/EIF4EBP axis, the downstream protein of this \nsignaling  including  RP-S6K  and  EIF4F  components,  in \nthe process of cataract formation.\nThere  were  some  limitations  to  this  present  study. \nFirstly, considering the data source from the GWAS meta-\nanalyses  statistic  data  of  mTOR-dependent  circulating \nprotein  and  cataract  were  restricted  in  individuals  with \nEuropean  ancestry,  we  are  unclear  whether  this  finding \ncan be applied to other populations. Thus, more sources \nof data are required to detect the effect on another eth-\nnicity.  Secondly,  although  sensitivity  analysis  results \nshowed  no  evidence  of  unbalanced  pleiotropy,  part  of \nbalanced  pleiotropy  may  exist.  Thirdly,  more  detailed \ninformation  on  the  subtype  of  cataracts  has  not  been \navailable  until  now.  Therefore,  further  research  on  the \nassociation between mTOR-dependent protein level and \nsubtype of cataracts is required. Fourthly, some research-\ners  indicated  that  the  GWAS  only  incorporated  3301 \nindividuals because of the expensive measuring technol-\nogy  of  plasma  protein[31].  Thus,  the  database  cannot \ndetect as many genome-wide significant genetic variants \nas possible. A more relaxed IV selection threshold might \nbalance  between  feasibility  of  the  study  and  statistical \npower. Additionally, some scholars chose the IV selection \n− 6  rather  than  the  commonly  used \nthreshold  to  be  P<5e\n− 8 to obtain sufficient SNPs \nGWAS significance level P<5e\nand to estimate more accurate results [29–31]. Therefore, \n− 6 \nwe set a more relaxed IV selection threshold to be P<5e\nrather than the commonly used GWAS significance level \n− 8.  Fifthly,  there  are  three  isoforms  for  EIF4EBP, \nof  P<5e\nincluding  EIF4EBP1,  EIF4EBP2  and  EIF4EBP3[61].  EIF-\n4EBP1 is abundant in adipose tissue, pancreas, and skel-\netal muscle, EIF4EBP2 is ubiquitously expressed[62], and \nEIF4EBP3  distributes  highest  in  skeletal  muscle,  heart, \nkidney,  and  pancreas[63].  Compared  with  EIF4EBP1, \nEIF4EBP2  gets  phosphorylated  at  lesser  residues[61], \nhas a binding preference with EIF4F [61], and has a more \neffective  blockade  by  rapamycin[64].  Considering  the \nwide distribution and function of EIF4EBP2, it might play \na more critical role in the cataract formation than other \ntwo isoforms. At the same time, due to the limitation of \nthe database, we could only incorporate EIF4EBP2 in this \nstudy.  Further  research  is  needed  to  test  the  interaction \nand  regulation  between  these  isoforms.  Lastly,  although \nthis  study  provided  a  credible  signaling  pathway  in  the \npathogenesis of cataracts, more experimental laboratory \ndata is warranted to verify its feasibility.\nConclusion\nThis unbiased two-sample MR study supports the causal \npositivity association between circulating EIF4EBP levels \nand  cataract  formation.  Furthermore,  using  the  in-vitro \nand in-vivo data of the previous studies, our results sug-\ngested  the  critical  role  of  the  mTORC1/EIF4EBP  axis  in \nthe  mechanism  of  cataract,  regardless  of  cataract  sub-\ntypes. However, further studies are required to verify this \npathway to explore the detailed functional relevance and \ndownstream  proteins  of  the  axis  and  to  further  investi-\ngate  its  clinical  utility.  Nevertheless,  the  finding  of  this \nstudy  will  provide  the  basis  for  a  more  efficient  phar-\nmacological  target  in  the  prevention  and  treatment  of \ncataracts.\nAbbreviations\nmTOR \nEMT \nmTORC1 \nmTORC2 \nPR-S6K  \nEIF4EBP \nEIF-4G \nEIF-4F \nEIF-4B \nEIF-4A \nEIF-4A \nSNP \nGWAS \nLEC \nPI3K \n mechanistic target of rapamycin\n epithelial-mesenchymal transition\n mechanistic target of rapamycin complex1\n mechanistic target of rapamycin complex2\n ribosomal protein S6K kinase\n eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein\n eukaryotic initiation factor 4G\n eukaryotic initiation factor 4F\n eukaryotic initiation factor 4B\n eukaryotic translation factor 4A\n eukaryotic translation factor 4A\n single-nucleotide polymorphisms\n genome-wide association studies\n lens epithelial cell\n phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi.\norg/10.1186/s12864-022-08925-7.\nSupplementary Material 1\nSupplementary Material 2\nSupplementary Material 3\nAcknowledgements\nWe want to acknowledge the participants and investigators of the FinnGen \nstudy.\nAuthor contributions\nJ.
