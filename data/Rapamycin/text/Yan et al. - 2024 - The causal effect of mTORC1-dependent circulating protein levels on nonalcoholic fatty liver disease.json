Incidence of NAFLD rises with \nincreased  living  standards,  changed  eating  habits  and  lifestyles, \nthreatening nearly a quarter of the global population. If not treated, \nNAFLD tends to develop severe liver damage, 25 % of which would \nprogress to liver ﬁbrosis and 1.5 %−8 % of which would progress \nto liver cirrhosis, even hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [2 , 3] . How- \never, the pathogenesis of NAFLD remains unclear. Currently, there \nis still no clinical intervention approved by the Food and Drug Ad- \nministration (FDA) for NAFLD. Thus, further exploration of NAFLD \npathogenesis and ﬁnding novel therapeutic targets remain topics \nof intense research. \nThe  mechanistic  target  of  rapamycin  (mTOR)  signaling  path- \nway  controls  cell  growth,  proliferation,  and  metabolism  depend- \n∗ Corresponding  author  at:  Department  of  Hepatobiliary  Surgery,  Shandong \nProvincial Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, 324, Jing 5 \nRoad, Jinan, Shandong 250021, China. \nE-mail address: dr_liujun1967@126.com (J. Liu) . \ning on hormones, growth factors, and nutrient availability, which \nnucleates  two  biochemically  and  functionally  distinct  complexes, \nknown  as  mTOR  Complex  1  (mTORC1)  and  mTOR  Complex  2 \n(mTORC2)  [4 , 5] .  mTORC1  consists  of  mTOR  and  the  regulatory- \nassociated protein of mTOR (Raptor), an adaptor protein, activat- \ning anabolic pathways such as lipid synthesis, as well as attenuat- \ning catabolic pathways such as oxidation [4 , 6] . Therefore, this ren- \nders mTORC1 an attractive target to regulate the lipid homeostasis \nof livers. However, existing studies reached conﬂicting conclusions \n[7–9] . This indicates a complex role of mTORC1 in NAFLD, which \nremains poorly understood. \nThe function of mTORC1 is dominantly regulated by the phos- \nphorylation of downstream proteins, mainly including Eukaryotic \nInitiation Factor 4E Binding Proteins (eIF4EBPs) and Ribosomal Pro- \ntein  S6K  kinase  1  (RP-S6K).  eIF4EBP  is  a  binding  protein  of  Eu- \nkaryotic  Initiation  Factor  4E  (eIF4E).  As  a  result  of  phosphoryla- \ntion, eIF4EBP is disassociated from eIF4E, leading to the activation \n(cid:3) cap-dependent protein translation [10 , 11] . eIF4E, together with \nof 5\nEukaryotic  Initiation  Factor  4A  (eIF4A)  and  Eukaryotic  Initiation \nFactor  4  G  (eIF4G),  forms  Eukaryotic  Initiation  Factor  4F  (eIF4F) \ncomplex [5] .

Ethical approval can be found in \nthe original literature, and we used publicly available statistics. \nFor IVs, we selected signiﬁcant genetic variants associated with \nmTORC1-dependent  circulating  proteins  from  the  GWAS  (signiﬁ- \ncant P < 5 × 10−6 ). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) describes correla- \ntions of genetic variants, which were due to the distance of phys- \nical locations. To ensure the selected SNPs were independent for \neach  exposure,  LD  was  satisﬁed  in  the  given  region  (R2  <  0.05, \nkb  >  10,0 0 0).  SNPs  of  palindromic  structures  were  eliminated. \nCragg-Donald F-statistic was used to evaluate the power of SNPs. \nSNPs of F < 10 would be considered weak instruments [18] . \n2.2. Summarized statistics of NAFLD \nWe extracted two summarized GWAS statistics of NAFLD, de- \nﬁned as the discovery dataset and validation dataset respectively. \nFor  the  discovery  dataset,  the  GWAS  statistics  were  obtained \nfrom  FinnGen  ( https://r8.ﬁnngen.ﬁ),  which  included  1908  cases \nand 340,591 controls, adjusting for sex, age, genotyping batch, ge- \nnetic relatedness, and ﬁrst 10 principal components. For the val- \nidation  dataset,  statistics  were  obtained  from  UK  Biobank  (UKB, \nhttps://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk )  with  361,194  samples,  adjusting  for \nsex, age, and the ﬁrst 20 principal components. For the remaining \nIVs, we used PhenoScanner ( https://phenoscanner.medschl.cam.ac. \nuk ) to ﬁnd possible correlations with NAFLD. We imputed the re- \nmaining IVs associated with each exposure to determine associa- \ntions with NAFLD and confounders. Ethical approvals can be found \nin each GWAS. In FinnGen Biobank, the FinnGen team conducted \nthe GWAS, and FinnGen Steering Committee approved the study. In \nUKB, Neale Lab performed the GWAS and the Ethics Advisory Com- \nmittee of the UKB approved the study. We used the publicly avail- \nable  summarized  statistics,  and  all  the  data  can  be  downloaded \nwithout restriction. \n2.3. MR design \nBeing  as  effective  IVs,  genetic  variants  need  to  be  met  with \nthe following three core assumptions. (i) Genetic variants are as- \nsociated with mTORC1-dependent circulating proteins. (ii) Genetic \nvariants are independent of confounders that have an impact on \nNAFLD  and  may  affect  the  “exposure-outcome” association.  (iii) \nGenetic  variants  affect  NAFLD  only  by  each  exposure.  The  effect \nof an SNP on an outcome and exposure must be harmonized to \nbe  relative  to  the  same  allele.  After  harmonizing,  a  two-sample \nMR  will  be  performed.  When  assessing  causal  effects  between \nmTORC1-dependent  circulating  proteins  and  NAFLD,  the  summa- \nrized statistics of NAFLD from the discovery dataset FinnGen were \ninitially used. Exposures with statistically signiﬁcant effects in the \ndiscovery  dataset  would  be  further  validated  in  the  validation \ndataset UKB. If statistically signiﬁcant effects were found in both \nthe discovery dataset and validations dataset, the exposure could \nbe considered to have causal effects with NAFLD. The MR ﬂowchart \nis shown in Fig. 2 . \n2.4. Statistical analysis and sensitivity analysis \nDue  to  the  highest  estimating  eﬃcacy,  the  Inverse  Variance \nWeighted  method  was  initially  used  for  the  MR  analysis,  and  a \nrandom-effect model was applied. In IVW, based on the association \nof IVs on exposures and the outcome, Wald estimates were calcu- \nlated, the variance of which was then used as weights to integrate \neach Wald estimates [19] . In addition, we performed the following \nMR methods as supplementary analysis of IVW. (i) Egger’s regres- \nsion for MR, where the horizontal pleiotropy was assumed to exist. \nFig. 1.

Main proteins of mTORC1 are present in Fig. 1 . \nRandomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are regarded as the opti- \nmal type of design for evaluating causal effects. However, restricted \nby medical ethics, subject compliance, study period, and other fac- \ntors,  appropriate  RCTs  are  diﬃcult  to  implement  in  many  cases. \nMendelian Randomization (MR) is a statistical model using genetic \nvariation as Instrumental Variables (IVs), which is widely applied \nin causal inference in recent years [13] . IVs are usually obtained \nfrom Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). During gametoge- \nnesis, genetic variants underwent random segregation and combi- \nnations. MR capitalizes on this feature of genetic variants to sim- \nulate the random allocation of the population. When an individ- \nual was born, randomly allocated genetic variants affecting speciﬁc \nphenotypes  had  been  already  determined.  This  process  is  com- \nmonly unrelated to acquired environmental confounders. Thus, dif- \nferences in the speciﬁc outcome of the population with or without \nsuch genetic variants can be attributed to exposures, thereby ruling \nout interferences of confounders [14] . \nIn  this  study,  we  performed  an  MR  study  to  investigate  the \ncausal effect between the risk of NAFLD and mTORC1-dependent \ncirculating protein levels, including eIF4EBPs, eIF4A, eIF4E, eIF4G, \nand  RP-S6K.  Considering  the  role  of  mTORC1  in  regulating  lipid \nhomeostasis  and  oxidation  of  the  liver,  we  hypothesized  that \nmTORC1-dependent  circulating  protein  levels  had  a  causal  effect \non NAFLD. \n2. Method \n2.1. Summarized statistics of mTORC1-dependent proteins \nDeﬁned  as  exposures,  we  applied  5  different  mTORC1- \ndependent  circulating  proteins,  including  eIF4EBPs,  eIF4A,  eIF4E, \neIF4G, and RP-S6K. SNPs related to the mTORC1-dependent pro- \nteins  were  obtained  from  a  recent  proteomics  GWAS  of  Euro- \npean participants, the INTERVAL study ( https://www.phpc.cam.ac. \nuk/ceu/proteins ) [15 , 16] . In this genomic bioresource, 50,0 0 0 blood \ndonors  from  25  centers  across  England  were  recruited  from \n2012  to  2014.  A  GWAS  of  3301  participants  from  the  INTERVAL \nstudy was performed where a SomaLogic ( https://somalogic.com ) \n560"},{"page":3,"text":"X. Yan, S. Huang, H.

Results were presented as Odds Ratios (ORs) \nwith P-values and 95 % conﬁdence intervals (CIs) or Beta-values \nwith P-values and standard errors (SEs). \nMultiple methods were applied for sensitivity analysis. We ex- \nplored the heterogeneity of IVW and MR-Egger through Cochrane \nQ Test [20] . Horizontal pleiotropy was tested using the following \nmethods. (i) The MR-Egger method was used for both MR analy- \nsis and pleiotropy test, in which intercept was returned [21] . (ii) \nThe MR Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO) test al- \nlows for the evaluation of pleiotropy in MR. MR-PRESSO tests the \nexistence of pleiotropy by removing outlier SNPs and estimating \ncorrected results, thus testing the difference before and after the \nremoval of outlier SNPs [22] . To acquire results of authenticity, the \nnumber  of  bootstrap  replications  was  set  at  10,0 0 0.  In  addition, \nwe performed multivariable MR analysis in the validation stage to \nfurther verify the robustness of the results. Considering potential \nheterogeneity, pleiotropy, and the problem of collinearity of each \nexposure, a following Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator \n(LASSO)  feature  selection  method  was  utilized  to  select  features \nand only retain relevant features and instruments, thus perform- \ning multivariable MR on remaining data [23] . \nStatistical  analysis  and  sensitivity  analysis  were  performed \nusing  the  R  software  ( https://r-project.org ),  version  4.2.2,  with \n“TwoSampleMR” and  “MRPRESSO” packages.  The  ﬁgures  were \ndrawn  by  Figdraw  ( https://www.ﬁgdraw.com/static/index.html#/ ) \nand the R software. \n3. Result \n3.1. MR analysis of eIF4E and RP-S6K in discovery stage \nOf 135 SNPs associating eIF4E, 117 variants were removed due \nto LD with other variants or absence from LD reference panel. After \nmerging clumped SNPs and GWAS of FinnGen, 16 SNPs remained, \nand 2 variants rs531476076 and rs7862784 were removed for be- \ning palindromic with intermediate allele frequencies. IVW method \nindicated that eIF4E protein level in plasma was statistically associ- \nated with a higher risk of NAFLD with OR of 1.339, P-value of 0.037. \nMR-Egger (OR = 1.417, P-value = 0.269) and WM (OR = 1.411, P- \nvalue = 0.068) methods did not show opposite results. \nOf 181 SNPs associating RP-S6K, 160 variants were removed due \nto LD with other variants or absence from LD reference panel. After \nmerging, 18 SNPs remained and 3 variants rs17412698, rs74353857, \nand  rs79549584  were  removed  for  being  palindromic  with  in- \ntermediate allele frequencies. No statistical association was found \nbetween  RP-S6K  protein  level  in  plasma  and  NAFLD  using  IVW \n(OR  =  1.162,  P-value  =  0.219)  and  MR-Egger  (OR  =  1.042,  P- \nvalue = 0.863) methods. However, WM method (OR = 1.389, P- \nvalue = 0.041) showed a higher risk of NAFLD with RP-S6K protein \nlevel in plasma. \nTo further validate the results mentioned above, eIF4E and RP- \nS6K  protein  levels  in  plasma  will  be  included  in  the  validation \ndataset to further test the causal effect on NAFLD. Results of MR \nanalysis were shown in Table 1 , and scatterplots were shown in \nFig. 3 . IVs were shown in supplementary materials. \n3.2. MR analysis of eIF4EBPs, eIF4A, and eIF4G in discovery stage \nAfter  removing  SNPs  due  to  LD  with  other  variants  and  be- \ning  palindromic  with  intermediate  allele  frequencies,  there  were \n9 SNPs predicting eIF4EBPs, 9 SNPs predicting eIF4A, and 7 SNPs \npredicting eIF4G. All of IVW, MR-Egger, and WM methods did not \nshow statistically signiﬁcant association between eIF4EBPs, eIF4A, \nand eIF4G protein levels in plasma and the risk of NAFLD. Given \nthe above results, eIF4EBPs, eIF4A, and eIF4G will not further test \nin the validation dataset. Results of MR analysis were presented in \nTable 1 . \n3.3. MR analysis of eIF4E and RP-S6K in validation stage \nDue to the different source of the validation dataset, remain- \ning SNPs got different sections from those in discovery stage. Af- \nter merging clumped SNPs and GWAS of UKB, 8 SNPs remained \nassociating eIF4E and 16 SNPs remained associating RP-S6K. Sim- \nilar results were successfully obtained. Results in validation stage \naligned with the discovery stage. IVW method showed that eIF4E \nprotein  level  in  plasma  (Beta  =  3.028  × 10−4 ,  P-value  =  0.022) \nwas associated with a higher risk of NAFLD, while RP-S6K protein \nlevel  (Beta  =  1.598  × 10−4 ,  P-value  =  0.12)  in  plasma  was  not. \nWM method further validated this association of eIF4E and NAFLD \n(P-value = 0.015).

The causal effect of RP-S6K and NAFLD remains ambiguous. \nResults in validation stage were shown in supplementary Table S1, \nand scatterplots were present in Fig. 3 . \n3.4. Sensitivity analysis \nHeterogeneity and pleiotropy tests of the discovery stage and \nvalidation  stage  were  shown  in  Table  1  and  supplementary  Ta- \nble  S1.  Apart  from  eIF4EBPs  (P-value  =  0.04)  and  eIF4G  (P- \nvalue  =  0.033),  no  heterogeneity  was  found  across  exposures  in \nboth stages using Cochrane Q Test. The source of heterogeneity was \nconsidered the low sample size, leading to a small number of se- \nlected SNPs. \nMR-PRESSO  and  MR-Egger  methods  were  applied  for  the \npleiotropy test. Through MR-PRESSO method, the robustness of re- \nsults was pruned by correcting outlier SNPs of each exposure. No \noutlier SNPs were found across all exposures in both discovery and \nvalidation stages. This abolished the effects of heterogeneity men- \ntioned above. However, pleiotropy was found in eIF4EBP with an \nMR-PRESSO P-value of 0.047. Besides, through MR-Egger methods, \nan intercept of each exposure was returned reﬂecting the size of \npleiotropy ( Fig. 3 ). There was no statistically signiﬁcant pleiotropy \nexisting across all exposures except eIF4G, with an MR-Egger inter- \ncept of −0.135 and a P-value of 0.049. \nForrest  plots  of  multivariable  MR  analysis  were  shown  in \nFig.  4 .  Before  LASSO  feature  selection,  no  statistical  signiﬁcance \nwas found across all exposures, although there was a strong trend \ntoward  signiﬁcance  in  eIF4E  (P-value  =  0.069).  After  LASSO  fea- \nture selection, eIF4E showed the statistically signiﬁcant causal ef- \nfect on NAFLD once again, with a P-value of 0.0188. Multiple meth- \nods demonstrated that this causal effect of eIF4E on NAFLD was of \nwell robustness and stability. \n4. Discussion \nTo the best of our knowledge, this study is the ﬁrst to examine \nthe potential causal effect of mTORC1-dependent circulating pro- \nteins and NAFLD risk through the MR approach. According to our \n562"},{"page":5,"text":"X. Yan, S. Huang, H. Li et al.\nDigestive and Liver Disease 56 (2024) 559–564\nFig. 4.

Levels of \neIF4EBP, eIF4A, eIF4G, and RP-S6K in plasma were not found to be \ncausally associated with the risk of NAFLD. In addition, pleiotropy \nand heterogeneity were not identiﬁed in our main ﬁndings through \nsensitivity analyses, and similar results were replicated using mul- \ntivariable MR analysis. This further suggested the robustness of our \nresults. \nIndeed, there has been evidence for effects of mTOR on NAFLD \nprogression.  Existing  data  indicate  that  mTOR  regulates  NAFLD \nthrough lipid metabolism [24 , 25] , insulin resistance [26] , oxidative \nstress [27] , intestinal ﬂora [28] , autophagy [29] , hepatic inﬂamma- \ntion  [30] ,  and  liver  genetic  polymorphisms  and  epigenetics  [31] . \nHowever, it has not been suﬃciently proven that the downstream \nproteins in mTORC1 pathway are involved. Wang et al. [32 , 33] ob- \nserved activated mTORC1 and increased downstream proteins in- \ncluding eIF4E due to inﬂammation stress-induced hepatic steatosis \nin vivo and in vitro, and mTOR inhibition could reverse this process \nand  lead  to  alleviation  of  hepatic  steatosis.  Given  inﬂammation \nstress could result in hepatic lipid accumulation, this result was \nconsistent with our ﬁndings. Study by Liu et al. [34] demonstrated \nsimilar  results  that  increased  mTORC1  activity  along  with  phos- \nphorylated  downstream  proteins  exacerbated  the  progression  of \nNAFLD by disrupting cholesterol homeostasis, in which hepatic in- \nﬂammation was induced by using 10 % casein injected apolipopro- \ntein E knockout mice in vivo and interleukin-1 stimulated hepG2 \nhepatoblastoma cell line in vitro . In another study by Liu et al. [24] , \nthey  observed  that  the  impaired  activity  of  mTORC1  decreased \nlipid droplets in hepatocytes. In parallel, restored mTORC1 activity \ninhibited lipophagy and lipid droplet degradation. Again, increased \nmTORC1 activity was observed in liver tissues of NAFLD patients \nby  restricting  hepatic  lipophagy.  In  addition,  a  clinical  trial  con- \nducted by Kubrusly et al. [35] demonstrated that the expression of \ndownstream effector of mTORC1 including eIF4E increased in non- \nalcoholic steatosis hepatitis-related cirrhosis. These also provided \nsupporting evidence for our hypothesis. \nCurrently  approved  treatment  for  NAFLD  is  recommended  to \npromote  healthy  lifestyle  behaviors  and  favorable  lifestyle  mod- \niﬁcation  (hypocaloric  diets,  regular  physical  activity,  weight  loss, \netc.).  Patients  suffering  from  NAFLD  have  shown  improvement \nthrough  such  approaches.  However,  the  pharmacotherapy  for \nNAFLD is poor. Finding eligible targets for pharmacological treat- \nment  of  NAFLD  remains  a  topic  of  intense  research.  So  far,  re- \nsearch conducted on mTOR suggested a vast potential for study- \ning mTOR as a therapeutic target for NAFLD. Study by Shen et al. \n[36] found that geniposide could alleviate NAFLD by suppressing \nthe phosphorylation of mTORC1 and its related proteins in mice. \nSimilarly,  Quan  et  al.  [37]  demonstrated  that  mTOR  and  RP-S6K \nwere reduced when hepatocytes were treated with betulinic acid, \nthereby ameliorating hepatic lipid accumulation. Nevertheless, sev- \neral other cellular pathways are also regulated by mTORC1.  It is \npossible to create unexpected effects by blunting the modulation \nof mTORC1. Thus, a recent study by Gosis et al. [38] used folliculin- \ndeleted mice to selectively inhibit mTORC1-mediated phosphoryla- \ntion of the transcription factor E3/B, while other mTORC1 targets \nwere hardly affected. Their results showed that this selected inhi- \nbition of mTORC1 could be a promising approach for the treatment \nof NAFLD. Our study found a deﬁnite causal association of eIF4E \nwith NAFLD. Therefore, we hypothesized that selected modulation \nof mTORC1 targets such as eIF4E could alleviate NAFLD, and there \nneed to be more attempts at such approach to developing speciﬁc \ntreatments for NAFLD in the future. \nIn this study, we performed a two-sample MR analysis. A ma- \njor strength of using genetic variation as IVs is that genetic vari- \nation  is  independent  of  social  contexts,  life  habits,  and  other \ntraits. This feature ensures balanced confounders in different sub- \ngroups, theoretically avoiding effects of confounders. On the other \nhand, the formation of genetic variation precedes exposures, con- \nfounders,  and  the  progression  of  diseases.  Therefore,  exposures \nrepresented  by  SNPs  also  precede  the  outcomes,  thus  excluding \nreverse  causality  [39] .  To  fulﬁll  the  assumptions  of  MR  design, \nﬁrstly, we strictly selected IVs strongly associated with mTORC1- \ndependent  circulating  protein  levels,  as  well  as  removing  con- \nfounding SNPs. IVW method was primarily adapted for its high- \nest  power  of  test.  MR-Egger  and  WM  were  used  as  supplemen- \ntary methods. Then, MR-Egger intercept and MR-PRESSO methods \nconﬁrmed little pleiotropy existing. Multiple methods of sensitivity \nanalyses evaluated the robustness and reliability based on discov- \nery  stage  and  validation  stage,  and  multivariable  MR  analysis  in \nvalidation stage with LASSO-feature-selection method further con- \nﬁrmed our results. \nSeveral limitations exist in this MR study. Firstly, only 3301 par- \nticipants were included in the GWAS from the INTERVAL study due \nto the complicated technology of measuring plasma proteins. As \na  result,  we  had  to  increase  the  threshold  of  IVs  selection  with \nP  <  5  × 10−6  instead  of  P  <  5  × 10−8 ,  which  might  introduce \na bias of weak IVs. Though there is a relatively small number of \nincluded individuals in this GWAS, it is large enough to select IVs \nand then perform MR study, and the threshold and sensitivity anal- \nyses  guaranteed  the  authenticity  of  our  results  and  conclusions. \nSecondly, GWAS data of NAFLD patients and mTOR-dependent cir- \nculating proteins was derived from European populations. Whether \nthis causal effect of eIF4E on NAFLD is generalized to other popula- \ntions remains unclear. Larger GWAS from different populations and \nregions are needed in the future. Besides, a key question for NAFLD \ncommunity is ﬁnding NAFLD severity-related SNPs and exploring \n563"},{"page":6,"text":"X. Yan, S. Huang, H. Li et al.\nDigestive and Liver Disease 56 (2024) 559–564\nassociation  of  risk  factors  with  the  severity  or  stages  of  NAFLD. \nHowever,  since  there  is  no  GWAS  of  NAFLD  severity,  we  cannot \nperform an MR study on such associations. At last, although we did \nnot ﬁnd effects of heterogeneity and pleiotropy in our main ﬁnding \nthrough multiple methods of sensitivity analyses, the difference in \nthe included populations does exist. Thus, potential heterogeneity \nand partial pleiotropy might exist. \n5. Conclusion \nIn conclusion, this two-sample MR study supports that geneti- \ncally predicted eIF4E protein level in plasma is causally associated \nwith the risk of NAFLD. A novel ﬁnding of this research suggests \nthat European ancestry populations with a higher level of mTOR- \ndependent eIF4E protein in plasma have a higher risk of NAFLD. \nNevertheless,  our  conclusion  is  based  on  GWAS  data,  and  high- \nquality research is required in the future to explore the detailed \nfunctional relevance and clinical utility. \nFunding \nThis study was supported by the National Natural Science Foun- \ndation of China , with grant number 81373172 and 81770646 . \nConﬂict of interest \nNothing to report. \nAuthor contribution \nXiangyu Yan: Conceptualization, Visualization, Writing – origi- \nnal draft, Writing – review & editing, Data curation, Formal analy- \nsis.
