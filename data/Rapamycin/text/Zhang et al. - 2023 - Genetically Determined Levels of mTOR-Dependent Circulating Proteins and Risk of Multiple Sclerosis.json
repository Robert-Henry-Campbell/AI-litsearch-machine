Even in the advanced stages,\npatients’ symptoms can be vague, although\naxonal\ninjury has been caused [2]. Thus,\ndetecting the condition as early as possible is\nvery important.\nof\ntarget\nThe mechanistic\nrapamycin\n(mTOR) is a 289-kDa serine/threonine protein\nkinase that serves as a downstream effector of\nthe PI3K/AKT pathway [3]. It is a primary com-\ntwo distinct protein complexes:\nponent of\nrapamycin-sensitive mTORC1 and rapamycin-\ninsensitive mTORC2. mTORC1 is generally\nactivated in response to various extracellular\nand intracellular stimuli, including hormones,\ngrowth factors, cytokines, oxidants, and amino\nacids, which occur on lysosomal membranes\n[4]. This kinase regulates protein translation via\nthe phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6\nkinase (RP-S6K) and eukaryotic initiation factor\n4E binding protein (eIF4E-BP)\n[5]. eIF4E-BP\ninhibits translation initiation by sequestering\ntranslation factor eIF4E from the eIF4F complex\n(eIF4E, eIF4G and eIF4A) [6]. mTORC2 is acti-\nvated by PI3K-mediated growth factors signal-\ning, and it phosphorylates AGC kinases, such as\nprotein kinase B (AKT), protein kinase C-alpha\n(PKC-a),\nserum and glucocorticoid-induced\nprotein kinase 1 (SGK1), to promote cell growth\nand cell proliferation [7] (Fig. 1).\nThe associations between MS and the mTOR,\nas revealed from epidemiological studies, have\nrecently attracted much attention [3]. However,\nthe role of mTOR in the progression of MS is\nstill controversial. For example, Mohammadar-\nian Akbari et al. [8] found that patients with MS\nhad a lower expression of mTOR-associated\nlong noncoding RNAs\nsuch as\nSNHG5 and DANCR. SNHG5 has been shown to\n(lncRNAs),"},{"page":3,"text":"Neurol Ther (2023) 12:751–762\n753\nFig. 1 Upstream and downstream regulation of mecha-\nnistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-related proteins.

In contrast, Fahimeh Akbarian\net al.\n[10] reported a higher expression of\nmTOR-related signals (mTOR, RPS6KB1, and\nEIF4EBP1) in relapsing–remitting MS.\nIt is still uncertain whether there is a causal\nrelationship between MS and mTOR.

Based on the widely\nresearched genome-wide association studies\n(GWAS), SNPs were used to stimulate the effects\nof exposures [11.

Moreover, heterogene-\nity in the sensitivities was not observed\n(Q = 10.657, PQ = 0.472). No horizontal pleio-\ntropy was detected (ER intercept = - 0.012;\nP = 0.552).

The IVW method showed\nthat the circulating level of RP-S6K was causally\nassociated with MS (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.00, 1.25;\nP = 0.045). No heterogeneity (Q = 8.995, PQ =\n0.253) or horizontal pleiotropy (ER inter-\ncept = - 0.004; P = 0.871) was detected.\nFor eIF4G, ER indicated signiﬁcant pleio-\ntropy (ER intercept = -0.067; P = 0.040). The\ncirculating level of eIF4G was associated with a\nhigher risk of MS (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.19, 2.36;\nP = 0.018) using MR-ER, and no heterogeneity\n(Q = 7.076, PQ = 0.457). However, no signiﬁcant\ncausation was found using the IVW or WME\nmethods.\nThe MR analyses showed no evidence of\nsigniﬁcant causal associations between the\nother four targets and MS, including AKT (IVW:\nOR 1.06, 95% CI 0.96–1.18; P = 1.177), eIF4E-BP\n(IVW: OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.90–1.20; P = 0.593),\neIF4A (IVW: OR 1.02, 95% CI\n0.95–1.10’\nP = 0.591), and eIF4E (IVW: OR 0.99, 95%\nCI 0.92–1.07, P = 0.786).\nDISCUSSION\nIn this MR study, summary-level data for the\nassociations of mTOR-related SNPs with the\noutcomes were obtained from large-scale GWAS\nor genetic consortia. Speciﬁcally, we investi-\ngated seven mTOR-dependent proteins and\nfound that PKC-a and RP-S6K are relevant fac-\ntors for MS risk, while AKT, eIF4E-BP, eIF4A,\neIF4E, and eIF4G were of no signiﬁcance in this\ncontext.\nThe present results appear to provide strong\nevidence in support of the inferred association\nbetween MS and mTOR. Compared with con-\nventional observational epidemiological stud-\nies, the inﬂuence of confounders and reverse\ncausality were minimized in our study and,\nconsequently, there was less potential con-\nfounding and fewer biases produced. Mean-\nwhile, we used summary statistics from GWAS\nstudies that have been used in several MR\nstudies [23, 24]. The large sample size of the two\nselected samples and the high number of cita-\ntions provide a high credibility to our results.\nThe role of mTOR in the progression of MS is\nstill controversial.

GWAS Genome-wide association study\nselected for\nof mTOR would curtail protein synthesis.\nRapamycin targeting of mTOR could elicit\nresponses resembling starved cells and block\ncells from processing beyond the G1 phase [25,\n26]. mTOR has been associated with the regu-\nlation of axonogenesis and cellular morpho-\ngenesis during neuronal differentiation [27],\nboth processes providing resistance to the pro-\ncession of MS. Among these mTOR-related\nproteins, PKC-a, a downstream signaling mole-\ncule of TREM2 and PLCc2, is a growth-associ-\nated protein after nerve damage;\ncan\nmodulate cytoskeletal reorganization and affect\nthe function of the microglia and macrophages\n[28]. Based on these features, PKC modulators\nare used as a novel therapy for neuroinﬂam-\nmatory and neurodegenerative diseases [29].\nThis is consistent with our ﬁndings. In our\nit\nstudy, PKC-a was demonstrated to be a protec-\ntive factor for MS.\nThe PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is associated\nwith autophagy and apoptosis, and autophagy\nhas signiﬁcant effects on neurons and astrocytes\n[30]. RP-S6K,\nthe upstream regulator of\nmTORC1, has been shown to affect the CNS by\nmediating autophagy and apoptosis [3] during\nwhich reactive oxygen is involved in oxidative\nstress,\nleading to neuronal axon loss and\ndemyelination during MS [31]. In the present\nstudy, we consider RP-S6K to be a risk factor for\nMS, which is consistent with the ﬁndings\nreported in other studies; for example, rapa-\nmycin can inhibit MS by increasing Teff and\ndecreasing Treg levels [30].\nAt present, age is a concerning factor in the\nstudies focused on mTOR and MS because of"},{"page":7,"text":"Neurol Ther (2023) 12:751–762\n757\nFig. 4 Forest plot of the results of mTOR-related proteins\nMendelian randomization (MR) analysis.
