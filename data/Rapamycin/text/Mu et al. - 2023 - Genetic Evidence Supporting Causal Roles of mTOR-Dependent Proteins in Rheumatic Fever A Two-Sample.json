The illness is character-\nized by various combinations of joint pain and\nswelling, cardiac valvular regurgitation with the\npotential for secondary heart failure known as\nrheumatic heart disease (RHD), chorea, subcu-\ntaneous nodules, erythema marginatum, and\nfever [2, 3]. The mortality rate of RF and its\nsequel, RHD, is comparable to that of rotavirus,\nand about 50% of that of malaria [4]. There are\napproximately 471,000 cases of acute rheumatic\n(ARF) each year, and approximately\nfever\n350,000 annual deaths as a result of ARF or RHD\n[2]. It is estimated to cause a USD2.2 trillion loss\nworldwide annually [5]. Thus, it is imperative to\ndetermine causal associations and to develop\nvalid strategies to illustrate the pathogene-\nsis that can help reduce the risk of RF.\nof\nThe mammalian target\nrapamycin\n(mTOR) is a serine/threonine protein kinase in\nthe phosphoinositide 3-kinase related kinase\nfamily that is the core catalytic component of\ntwo distinct protein complexes, known as\nmTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) and 2 (mTORC2)\n[6, 7].The mTOR signaling controls various cel-\nlular processes, including apoptosis, autophagy,\ntranslation, energy metabolism, and inﬂamma-\ntion [8]. Therefore, the regulation of mTOR\nprovides a new therapeutic strategy for various\ndiseases. However, the role of mTOR in RF is still\nnot fully clear.\nAt present, rapamycin has achieved promis-\ning progress\ninﬂammatory\nin alleviating\nautoimmune diseases, including mouse models\nof lupus and multiple sclerosis [9, 10]. MTORC1\nis a central hub of metabolic and inﬂammatory\nsignaling, which initiates biosynthetic path-\nways for cell growth and proliferation via\nphosphorylation of ribosomal S6K and eukary-\notic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). It is also known\nto suppress autophagy, which is critical to pro-\nviding energy and molecular building blocks by\nrecycling macromolecules in response to nutri-\nent and environmental stress [11, 12]. However,\nthe causality from mTOR on RF remains\nunknown. This study mainly explores the cau-\nsal relationship between mTOR and RF.\nMendelian randomization (MR) is an ana-\nlytical approach that utilizes genetic variants,\ngenerally single nucleotide polymorphisms\n(SNPs), as instrumental variables for exposure to\ndiminish confounding and reserve causality,\nthereby strengthening the causal inference of"},{"page":3,"text":"1592\nAdv Ther (2023) 40:1590–1600\ninherent\nan exposure-outcome association, which can\novercome confounding biases\nin\nobservational studies. In this study, we investi-\ngated whether the risk of RF varied with pro-\nteins related to mRNA translation in mTORC1\nsignaling (EIF4EBP2, EIF-4E, EIF-4G, EIF-4A, and\nRP-S6K), and proteins associated with Inhibit-\ning protein catabolism in mTORC1 signaling\n(ATG7).\nMETHODS\nGenetic Datasets\nthe exposure of\nGenetic prediction of\nthe\nmTOR-related GWAS data was obtained from\nthe publicly available INTERVAL study Pro-\nteomics GWAS data. The study quantiﬁed 3,622\nplasma proteins in 3,301 healthy participants\nfrom the INTERVAL study in whom a SomaLo-\ngic aptamer-based plasma protein assay had\nbeen run [13]. https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/\nceu/proteins/ We applied the genetic predic-\ntors of mTOR downstream targets, namely\nEIF4EBP2, EIF-4E, EIF-4G, EIF-4A, RP-S6, and\nATG7,\nto determine the causal association\nbetween mTOR-downstream targets and RF.\nThe outcome dataset was obtained from the\nIntegrative Epidemiology Unit GWAS database\n(https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk), which includes\n38,209 cases and 156,711 healthy controls of\nEuropean ancestry. The database was developed\nat the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit at\nthe University of Bristol. This resource is a\nmanually curated collection of complete GWAS\nsummary datasets made available as open-\nsource ﬁles for download.\nSelection of genetic instruments\nThe exposure data with known genetic determi-\nnants are also called instrumental variables (IV)\n[14]. We applied the genetic predictors of mTOR\ndownstream targets, namely EIF4EBP2, EIF-4E,\nEIF-4G, EIF-4A, RP-S6K, and ATG7, to determine\nthe causal association between mTOR-down-\nstream targets and RF. Firstly, we chose SNPs that\nlevel\nreached a genome-wide\nsigniﬁcance\n(p\\5 9 10–6), identifying the SNPs relevant to\nEIF4EBP2, EIF-4E, EIF-4G, EIF-4A, RP-S6K and\nATG7. To prevent bias of results for strongly\nassociated SNPs and to ensure that SNPs were\nvalid and independent, the linkage disequilib-\nrium threshold for clumping was\nto\nR2\\0.001. We evaluated the strength of the gene\ninstrument from the F-statistic using an approx-\nimate approach, excluding SNPs with F-statis-\ntic\\10 to eliminate weak instrument bias.\nset\nIn addition, Phenoscanner\n(http://www.\nphenoscanner.medschl.cam.ac.uk/) analyzed a\ncurated database of publicly available results\nfrom large-scale genetic association studies [15].\nTo see whether these SNPs were associated with\npotential risk factors, including smoking and\ndrinking, we removed SNPs related to any\npotential confounders at genome-wide signiﬁ-\ncance (Fig. 1).\nStatistical Analyses\nWe performed the MR analysis using the ﬁxed-\neffects inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method\nas the primary analysis to evaluate the causal\nassociations between mTOR-downstream tar-\ngets and RF. This method provided the most\nrobust causal estimates while being relatively\nthe weighted\nsensitive to pleiotropy. Thus,\nmedian method, the MR-Egger regression, and\nthe MR Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier\nmethod were further applied as supplementary\nanalyses [16, 17]. Egger regression, a tool to\ndetect slight study bias in meta-analysis, can be\nadapted to test for bias from pleiotropy. We\nfurther assessed the horizontal polytropic using\nthe MR-Egger intercept test and leave-one-out\nanalyses. Cochran’s Q test was also used to\nidentify heterogeneity. In addition, the leave-\none-out sensitivity test was carried out, which\nthe\nmainly calculates\nremaining IVs after removing IVs one by one. If\nthe MR results estimated by other IVs after\nremoving an IV signiﬁcantly differ from the\ntotal results, it indicates that the MR results are\nsensitive to the IV.

The data suggest that\nhigher circulating levels of RP-S6K may be cau-\nsally associated with lower RF risk, and higher\ncirculating levels of ATG7 may be associated\nwith higher RF risk, whereas EIF4EBP2, EIF-4E,\nEIF-4G, EIF-4A had no signiﬁcant correlation\nwith RF. Our study is the ﬁrst to assess the risk\nbetween mTOR and RF using MR, and our\nﬁndings reafﬁrm the possibility of mTOR in\nalleviating inﬂammatory autoimmune diseases.\nIn our study, RP-S6K was a protective factor\nof RF. RP-S6K, ribosomal protein S6 kinase, is a\nwell-characterized target for mTORC1-mediated\nphosphorylation, which induces phosphoryla-\ntion and activation of S6 to stimulate protein\ntranslation [18, 19]. mTOR plays a profound\nrole in T cell lineage development. Speciﬁcally,\nit refers to promoting Th17 cell differentiation\nby S6K1 and S6K2. Mechanistically, S6K1\nimpinges on the downregulation of Gﬁ1, a\nnegative regulator of Th17 differentiation. At\nAdv Ther (2023) 40:1590–1600\nthe same time, S6K2 acts as a nuclear ‘‘carrier’’\nfor the transcription factor RORc required for\nTh17 differentiation [9, 20].\n(Fig. 5) Thus,\nmTOR may regulate T-cell metabolism by acti-\nvating S6K and ultimately affect autoimmunity\nafter Streptococcus infection.\nATG7 is considered to be a risk factor for RF.\nATG7 is a ubiquitin-like ligase that forms clas-\nsical bilayer-like autophagosomes, which play a\nvital role in the two ubiquitination modiﬁca-\ntions of autophagosomes formed by autophagic\nvesicles, occurring in the ATG5-ATG12 system\nand the LC3 system, respectively. Atg7 acts as\nE1 ubiquitin activase Atg12. Then, Atg12 is\ndelivered to the E2 ubiquitin transferase Atg10.\nFinally, Atg12 binds to Atg5 to form a complex.\nAfter that, it is combined with Atg16L to form\nthe ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L complex on the\nautophagosome’s outer membrane, promoting\nthe transfer of LC3 (Atg8) from Atg3 to the\nsubstrate phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE). LC3\nincludes two interconvertible forms, LC3-I and\nLC3-II, which are involved in autophagosome\nmembrane formation. Atg7 acts as an E1\nenzyme to mediate the coupling of LC3-I to the\nFig. 5 a Signaling pathways downstream of mTORC1.\nb Schematic of the transformation of autophagic vesicles\ninto autophagosomes.

MTOR is involved in the induction\nand initiation of autophagy [24]. Several recent\nstudies have conﬁrmed that autophagy may be\nactivated in mice inoculated with Streptococcus\npeptidoglycan polysaccharide, which appears to\nbe consistent with increased expression of\nATG7 autophagy initiation-related proteins.\nmTOR protein expression was lower in mice\nafter rapamycin treatment than in mice vacci-\nnated\npeptidoglycan\nstreptococcal\npolysaccharide [25]. In addition, Inomata et al.\ndemonstrated that ATG7 is an essential com-\nponent of the autophagy machinery, charac-\nterized by its independence from the members\nof the autophagic preinitiation complex. The\noccurrence of autophagy mediated by ATG7 has\nbeen observed in bone marrow-derived macro-\nphages of\nstreptococcal-infected mice [26].\nTherefore, due to the characteristics of the\nautophagy mechanism, it is hypothesized that\nATG7 affects RF after streptococcal infection.\nwith\nCurrently, RF is mainly treated by timely and\nappropriate antibiotic therapy for streptococcal\nA infection. This study demonstrates a causal\nrelationship between mTOR and RF. Therefore,\nit may provide new ideas for developing related\ntarget drugs. MTOR inhibitors are effective\nimmunosuppressive drugs for the prevention of\nacute rejection after solid organ transplantation\n[27]. They affect transcription and protein syn-\nthesis by integrating various signaling stimuli,\nand ultimately regulate cell apoptosis, growth\nand autophagy. Scientists have linked mTOR to\nvarious disease processes, such as neoplasia,\narthritis, insulin resistance, and osteoporosis.\nDue to their inhibitory effects on cell growth\nand metabolic signaling pathways, they have\nrecently been developed as antitumor-targeted\ntherapies for various cancers [28]. Currently,\ntwo mTOR inhibitors (temsirolimus and ever-\nolimus) have been approved by the US Food and\nthe\nEuropean\nDrug Administration and\nMedicines Agency for the oncology market [29].\nBecause S6K isoforms play an essential role in\nthe development and progression of several\ndiseases, S6K isoforms are often considered\npotential therapeutic targets [30]. PF-4708671 is\nthe ﬁrst reported S6K1-speciﬁc inhibitor, which\nhas only been reported to reduce the ﬁbrotic\narea and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes [31]. The\nmajority of mTOR-targeted therapies have been\nattributed to the inhibition of translation, and\ntreatments are currently being investigated at\nthis level of unregulated protein synthesis.\nMoreover, natural product-derived small mole-\ncule pomiferin triacetate as a novel mTORC1/\nC2 inhibitor has been identiﬁed to be effective\nat low micromolar concentrations and to efﬁ-\nciently attenuate translation [32]. mTOR, as the\nmaster switch of cell metabolism, is an adequate\ntarget protein for anticancer drugs. Therefore,\nmany mTOR inhibitors are used as anticancer\ndrugs in the clinic. However, resistance may\ndevelop,\nso continuously developing new\nallosteric mTOR inhibitors is necessary. Due to\nthe high molecular weight and more chiral\ncarbon of mTOR inhibitors, it is not easy to\nsynthesize them. In the future, we can start with\nstructural modiﬁcation to improve their prop-\nerties, develop new drug formulations, and\ncarry out the treatment of other diseases [33].\nOur\ninto the\ndevelopment of mTOR inhibitors for the treat-\nment of RF.\nstudy also provides\ninsights\nThis study has several strengths. First, for the\nﬁrst time, MR analysis was employed to explore\nthe causality of mTOR with RF, which could\nvastly reduce the inﬂuence of the environmen-\ntal confounders and reverse causality, and be\nless prone to the bias of observational studies.\nHowever, several limitations should be consid-\nered when interpreting our ﬁndings. First, MR\nhas only been analyzed through GWAS data,\nand this study lacks clinical trial veriﬁcation.\nTherefore, we only speculate that mTOR and RF\nhave a great possibility of correlation, which\nneeds to be veriﬁed by follow-up experimental\ntrials. Second, all GWAS data came from the\nEuropean population. Whether our described\nﬁndings would be consistent in other people\nremained to be investigated."},{"page":9,"text":"1598\nAdv Ther (2023) 40:1590–1600\nCONCLUSION\nRP-S6K could be identiﬁed as a protective factor\nfor RF, whereas ATG7 was a risk factor for RF.\nThese ﬁndings may provide new insights into\nthe intervention of RF.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nData about the mTOR-related GWAS data was\nobtained from the INTERVAL study Proteomics-\nGWAS data.
