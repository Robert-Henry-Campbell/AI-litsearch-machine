Globally, OP prevalence is on\nthe rise due to an aging population [3, 4]. Bone\nmineral density (BMD) is a measurable and\npowerful index for diagnosing OP in the clinical\nﬁeld [5]. The WHO has established diagnostic\ncriteria for osteoporosis by utilizing BMD\nT-scores.\nthe\nIncreasing evidence suggests that bone for-\nmation and resorption as well as osteoporosis\ntreatment are affected by the mechanistic tar-\nget-of-rapamycin (mTOR) pathway [6]. mTOR is\na serine-threonine protein kinase that partici-\npates in the formation of two structural and\nfunctional complexes named mTOR complex 1\n(mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2)\n[7]. The mTOR is critical cellular signaling that\nplays an essential role in regulating cell prolif-\neration, autophagy, and apoptosis by coordi-\nnating\ngrowth and metabolism of\neukaryotic cells [7], which also serves as a reg-\nulator of bone metabolism related to promoting\nosteoblastic differentiation and increasing bone\nmatrix synthesis [8, 9]. Xu et al. [10] reported\nthat activation of mTORC1 in B lymphocytes\npromotes osteoclast formation. The mTORC1,\nwhich contains mTOR, G protein b-unit-like\nprotein, and regulatory-associated protein of\nmTOR (Raptor) [11], regulates two downstream\nfactors called ribosomal protein-S6 kinase (RP-\nS6K) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor\n4E-binding protein (EIF4E-BP). The EIF4E-BP is a\nnegative regulator of the EIF-4F complex, which\ncomprises three proteins (EIF-4A, EIF-4E, and\nEIF-4G).\ncausality\nAlthough mounting evidence has empha-\nsized the essential role of mTOR in regulating\nbone homeostasis,\nremains\nthe\nuncertain since they are based on observational\nstudies. Therefore, to explore the causal associ-\nation between mTOR and OP, we conducted a\nmendelian randomization analysis of BMD at\nfour sites: femur, forearm, lumbar spine, and\nﬁve mTOR-dependent\ncalcaneus\nwith"},{"page":3,"text":"Adv Ther (2023) 40:4987–4998\n4989\ncirculating proteins: RP-S6K, 4EBP, EIF-4A, EIF-\n4E, and EIF-4G.\nMETHODS\nData Sources\nIn this study, BMD is regarded as a crucial index\nto evaluate the risk of osteoporosis. The fol-\nlowing genome-wide association study (GWAS)\ndata were obtained from a meta-analysis pub-\nlished at genetic factors for osteoporosis con-\nsortium (GEFOS) in 2015 [12]: forearm bone\nmineral density (FA-BMD), femoral neck bone\nmineral density (FN-BMD), and lumbar spine\nbone mineral density (LS-BMD). For FA-BMD,\n8143 individuals were included. Meanwhile, a\ntotal of 32,735 individuals for FN-BMD and\n28,489 individuals for FA-BMD were evaluated.\nAll of the participants were from European\npopulations. Based on sex, weight, age, and age\nsquared, BMD was adjusted. Summary statistics\nfor estimated heel bone mineral density (eBMD)\nwere obtained from the IEU GWAS database\n[13], which contained 426,824 European par-\nticipants, 55% of whom were female. We con-\nﬁrmed these data from the publicly available\nGWAS catalog website (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/\ngwas/downloads/summary-statistics)\n[14]. For\nthe data about mTOR-dependent circulating\nproteins, a proteomics-GWAS INTERVAL study\ninvolving 3301 participants was conducted,\nwhich included 3600 plasma protein assays\n[15]. The study was performed in accordance\nwith the Helsinki Declaration of 1964 and its\nfor this\nlater amendments. Patient consent\nstudy was not necessary because the study was\nnon-interventional and data were de-identiﬁed.\nSelection of Instrumental Variables\n(IVs),\n(SNPs)\ninstrumental variables\nAs\nsingle-nu-\ncleotide polymorphisms\nrelated to\ncirculating proteins were\nmTOR-dependent\nemployed. These SNPs were strongly (p value\n5 9 10–6) and independently (r2 \\ 0.001) linked\nwith the\nthree\nassumptions for MR analysis which included\nexposure,\nsatisfying\nthe\nthe following: ﬁrst, a genetic variation is asso-\nciated with a particular exposure; second, con-\nfounding pathways are not affected by genetic\nvariation in the outcomes; third, genetic varia-\ntion will not affect the results directly but only\nindirectly through exposure. To reduce the\npossibility of statistical bias in the original\nGWSA, SNPs with a minor allele frequency\n(MAF) of \\ 0.01 were excluded because of their\nlow conﬁdence. SNPs with inconsistent alleles\n(e.g., T/C vs. T/G) and palindromic SNPs with\nambiguous alleles (e.g., T/A vs. C/G) were har-\nmonized by ﬂipping the outcome variants. To\nexclude the instrumental SNPs showing a strong\nand con-\nassociation with the outcomes\nfounders,\n(http://www.\nphenoscanner.medschl.cam.ac.uk/phenoscann\ner) was utilized. The exposure-related instru-\nmental SNPs were then taken out of the out-\ncome datasets. Finally, F-statistics was used to\nfulﬁll the relevance assumption, and F-statis-\ntics [ 10 was regarded as valid instruments.\nPhenoScanner\nthe\nMR Analysis\nMR analysis was used to estimate the causative\neffect of exposure variables on the outcome. In\nthis study, we evaluated the causal associations\nbetween mTOR protein (RP-S6K, 4EBP, EIF-4A,\nEIF-4E, and EIF-4G) and BMD at different\nskeletal sites (FA-BMD, LS-BMD, FN-BMD, and\neBMD) based on the summary statistics (b\ncoefﬁcients and standard errors). The MR anal-\nysis we used were inverse variance weighting\n(IVW), MR-Egger\nregression, and weighted\nmedian (WM). These MR methods were detailed\nin published studies [16, 17]. Among these\nmethods, IVW is the most important for esti-\nmating the causal effect between exposure and\noutcome [18]. When there is no directional\npleiotropy (p for MR-Egger intercept [ 0.05)\namong the instrumental SNPs, the IVW method\nwas considered the most reliable [19]. The MR\nanalyses were performed with the R language\nand environment using the TwoSampleMR\npackage [20]. We used the odds ratio (95%\nconﬁdence interval) to express the estimated\neffect value, which can be recorded as per 1-SD"},{"page":4,"text":"4990\nAdv Ther (2023) 40:4987–4998\nincrement in each mTOR protein with the odds\nratio (OR) of OP.\nCausality Between mTOR Protein and OP\nSensitivity Analysis\nDue to the absence of the assumption of pleio-\ntropy in MR, the following sensitivity analysis\nwas performed to verify the reliability of the\nanalysis. First, Cochran’s Q statistics were\napplied to assess the IVs’ heterogeneity. Second,\nMR-Egger regression was used to determine\nwhether the selected IVs had pleiotropic effects.\nWhether horizontal pleiotropy affects\nthe\nresults of MR analysis using the intercept term\nfrom MR-Egger regression was evaluated [21].\nin MR-Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and\nThird,\nOutlier (MR-PRESSO) analysis, a causal effect\nestimate was reduced by removing SNPs related\nto heterogeneity. Finally, we used leave-one-out\nvalidation to assess each IVs’ sensitivity. Funnel\nplots were used to evaluate the heterogeneity\namong SNPs as well.\nRESULTS\nSNP Selection\nAs mentioned earlier, we selected independent\nSNPs (r2 \\ 0.001, p \\ 5 9 10-6) associated with\nthe exposure. Fifteen SNPs were extracted as\nsigniﬁcant predicted SNPs of RP-S6K. Fifteen\nSNPs were extracted as signiﬁcant associated\nSNPs of 4EBP. Sixteen SNPs were selected as\nsubstantial predicted SNPs of EIF-4E. Nine SNPs\nwere identiﬁed as signiﬁcant predicted SNPs of\nEIF-4G. Ten SNPs were considered signiﬁcant\nindicating SNPs of EIF-4A (Fig. 1). The mean\nF-statistic ranged from 28.02 to 52.69, which is\nabove the standard cutoff\nindicating\nsufﬁcient instrumental strength. SNP-speciﬁc\ninformation is\nreported in Supplementary\nTables. As a result, those signiﬁcant SNPs of\nmTOR protein were eventually used as IVs for\nthe MR analysis.\n([ 10)\nIn the two-sample MR analysis, the level of EIF-\n4E had a strong causal relationship with FA-\nBMD (OR = 0.938, 95% CI 0.887, 0.991,\np = 0.024) according to the IVW (Fig. 2A).\nHowever, RP-S6K, 4EBP, EIF-4A, and EIF-4G\nshowed no causal relationship with FL-BMD, LS-\nBMD, FA-BMD, or eBMD in different MR\nmethods (p [ 0.05) (Fig. 2B–D, Table 1).\nEIF-4E was causally associated with FA-BMD\naccording to IVW analysis. Regarding sensitiv-\nity, no directional pleiotropy was evident in the\nMR-Egger ﬁnding (intercept = 0.010, p = 0.59).\nNo single SNP strongly inﬂuenced causality\nbetween EIF-4E and FA-BMD in the leave-one-\nout analysis (Fig. 3). Based on the symmetry of\nthe funnel plots, our study strictly adhered to\nthe IV assumptions (Supplementary Figures).\nMoreover, there was no evidence of hetero-\ngeneity in IVW (Q = 9.723, p = 0.716). The\nremaining mTOR-dependent circulating pro-\nteins are shown in the Supplementary Figures.\nDISCUSSION\nIn the present study, we identiﬁed causal asso-\nciations of mTOR-dependent circulating pro-\nteins with various skeletal sites. The results\nindicated that a genetically higher level of EIF-\n4E was positively associated with higher FA-\nBMD in the IVW analysis. In addition, we found\nno association between proteins (RP-S6K, 4EBP,\nEIF-4A, and EIF-4G) with FN-BMD, LS-BMD, and\neBMD.\nAs the elderly population grows, OP gradu-\nally becomes a global health problem.

This signaling pathway is made up of a\ntriad of RANKL RANK, and OPG, which are all\nmembers of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF-)\nsuperfamily [33]. According to Choi and Arron\n[34] in 2000, bone resorption and T cells are\nrelated, and ‘‘bone immunology’’\nis further\ndeﬁned as the study of the relationship between\nbone resorption and T cells. The Th17 cells\npromote bone resorption in both direct and\nindirect ways. On the one hand, osteoclast\nprecursors express RANKL [35], which leads to\nosteoclastic differentiation by binding to RANK\n[36]. Furthermore, the Th17 cytokines strongly\ninduced RANKL expression [34]. On the other\nhand, IL-17 secreted by Th17 cells promotes\nRANKL expression in osteoclastogenesis-sup-\nporting cells, increasing bone resorption [37].\nTreg cells can inhibit osteoclast formation by\npreventing RANKL expression [38]. It has been\ndemonstrated that Treg cells\nimpact bone\nmainly through a contact-dependent mecha-\nnism and an inhibitory cytokine-dependent\nmechanism [39]. In addition, either activation\nof intracellular effectors by Treg cells or TGF-b\nsecreted by Treg can promote osteoblast prolif-\neration and differentiation [40].\nWe found a causal relationship between EIF-\n4E and FA-BMD, suggesting the mTOR pathway\nis a possible therapeutic target for OP. The EIF-\n4E is a downstream target of mTORC1/4EBP.\nThe mTORC1 controls the translation process\nthrough the phosphorylation of EIF4EBP.\nUnphosphorylated 4EBP binds to EIF-4E and\ninhibits the formation of translation initiation\ncomplex 4F (eIF4F) to prevent translation [41]\n(Fig. 4). Takashi Iezaki et al. [42] reported that\nthe mTORC1/4EBP cascade regulates the trans-\nlation of NRA in undifferentiated mesenchymal\ncells, indicating the role of the mTORC1/4EBP\naxis in skeletal development. Currently, EIF-4E\nhas been involved in tumorigenesis. It has been\nconsidered a potential therapeutic target in\nbone cancer [43, 44], but the study of EIF-4E in\nOP is still in its infancy.

Also, a\ndeﬁciency of Tregs was found in patients with\nOP [46].
