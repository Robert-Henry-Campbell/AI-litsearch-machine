Soliman1* & C. Mary Schooling1,2\nThe mammalian Target of Rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) nutrient‑sensing pathway is a central \nregulator of cell growth and metabolism and is dysregulated in diabetes. The eukaryotic translation \ninitiation factor 4E (EIF‑4E) protein, a key regulator of gene translation and protein function, is \ncontrolled by mTORC1 and EIF‑4E Binding Proteins (EIF4EBPs). Both EIF4EBPs and ribosomal \nprotein S6K kinase (RP‑S6K) are downstream effectors regulated by mTORC1 but converge to \nregulate two independent pathways. We investigated whether the risk of type 2 diabetes varied with \ngenetically predicted EIF‑4E, EIF‑4A, EIF‑4G, EIF4EBP, and RP‑S6K circulating levels using Mendelian \nRandomization. We estimated the causal role of EIF‑4F complex, EIF4EBP, and S6K in the circulation \non type 2 diabetes, based on independent single nucleotide polymorphisms strongly associated \n(p = 5 × 10–6) with EIF‑4E (16 SNPs), EIF‑4A (11 SNPs), EIF‑4G (6 SNPs), EIF4EBP2 (12 SNPs), and \nRP‑S6K (16 SNPs). The exposure data were obtained from the INTERVAL study. We applied these \nSNPs for each exposure to publically available genetic associations with diabetes from the DIAbetes \nGenetics Replication And Meta‑analysis (DIAGRAM) case (n = 26,676) and control (n = 132,532) study \n(mean age 57.4 years). We meta‑analyzed SNP‑specific Wald‑estimates using inverse variance \nweighting with multiplicative random effects and conducted sensitivity analysis. Mendelian \nRandomization (MR‑Base) R package was used in the analysis. The PhenoScanner curated database \nwas used to identify disease associations with SNP gene variants. EIF‑4E is associated with a lowered \nrisk of type 2 diabetes with an odds ratio (OR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (0.88, 0.99, p = 0.03) with \nsimilar estimates from the weighted median and MR‑Egger. Similarly, EIF‑4A was associated with \nlower risk of type 2 diabetes with odds ratio (OR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (0.85, 0.97, p = 0.0003). \nSensitivity analysis using MR‑Egger and weighed median analysis does not indicate that there is a \npleiotropic effect. This unbiased Mendelian Randomization estimate is consistent with a protective \ncausal association of EIF‑4E and EIF‑4A on type 2 diabetes. EIF‑4E and EIF‑4A may be targeted for \nintervention by repurposing existing therapeutics to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.\nAbbreviations\nSNPs \nmTOR \nEIF-4E \nEIF4EBP2 \nmTORC1 \nmTORC2 \n Single nucleotide polymorphism\n Mammalian target of rapamycin\n Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E\n Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 2 (4E-BP)\n Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1\n Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2\n1Department  of  Environmental, Occupational  and Geospatial  Health Sciences, The City University  of  New York, \nGraduate School of Public Health and Health Policy, 55 West 125th St, New York, NY 10027, USA. 2School of Public \nHealth, Li Ka Shing, Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, 7 Sassoon Road, Hong Kong, China. *email: \nghada.soliman@sph.cuny.edu\nScientific RepoRtS  |        (2020) 10:15737  \n| https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71987-8\n1"},{"page":2,"text":"GWAS \nIVW \nWM \nMR \nRP-S6K \n Genome-wide association studies\n Inverse variance weighted\n Weighted median\n Mendelian randomization\n Ribosomal protein S6K kinase\nDiabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases globally and in the US and is associated with several \nco-morbidities. In 2015, it was estimated that 9.4% of the US population, or approximately 30.3 million people \nhave  diabetes1. Among those, only 23.1 million people are diagnosed, and about 7.2 million are undiagnosed. \nType 2 diabetes represents approximately 90 to 95% of all diabetes cases. The estimated direct medical costs of \ndiagnosed diabetes in 2017 was $237 billion in the US with an average medical expenditure of diagnosed person \nof $13,700 per  year2. It is further estimated that 33.9% of US adults have prediabetes. To date, the causes of type \n2 diabetes are not fully understood. Diabetes is also associated with multiple co-morbidities and complications, \nincluding obesity. Thus, there is an urgent need to determine causal associations and develop new strategies for \nprevention, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of type 2 diabetes.\nThe mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase and a key \nregulator of cell growth and  metabolism3–5. As such, mTOR protein is a central metabolic integrator and is \ndysregulated in type 2 diabetes and diabetes-associated co-morbidities6–8. Importantly, mTOR is a druggable \nprotein and therefore is a potential target for type 2 diabetes interventions. It nucleates two functionally-distinct \nand mutually-exclusive complexes, namely mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2). \nBoth mTORC1 and mTORC2 regulate cellular metabolism, survival, proliferation, and growth. mTORC1 is a \ncentral hub for nutrient-sensing and energy metabolism and, as such, coordinates anabolic protein and nucleotide \nsynthesis and catabolic  autophagy9–16. On the other hand, mTORC2 drives insulin signaling by phosphorylating \nAkt (Ser473)/PKB downstream of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/insulin  pathway17–20.\nThe mTORC1, which binds exclusively to Raptor protein and other partners (Fig. 1), regulates two down-\nstream effectors, namely, Ribosomal Protein-S6 kinase 1 (RP-S6K 1) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor \n4E-binding protein (EIF4EBP). The first mTORC1 target, RP-S6K1 phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initia-\ntion factor 4B (EIF-4B), which is a positive regulator of EIF-4F  complex21. In addition, RP-S6K also phospho-\nrylates the programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4), which is a negative regulator of EIF-4A and targets it to \ndegradation via the ubiquitin  pathway22. The second mTORC1 downstream target, EIF4EBP, is a repressor of \nthe translation initiation complex (EIF-4F), which is required for 5′cap-dependent translation of mRNA (Fig. 1). \nOnce phosphorylated by mTORC1, EIF4EBP dissociates from EIF-4E, allowing for the assembly of the EIF-4F \ncomplex and initiation of 5′cap-dependent translation. The EIF-4F complex consists of EIF-4E, EIF-4G, and EIF-\n4A. EIF-4E binds to 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5′-UTR of eukaryotic mRNA and mediates the recruitment of \nmRNA on ribosomes to start protein translation. As mentioned earlier, the mTOR kinase attracts different protein \npartners to generate two functionally distinct complexes, namely, mTORC1 and mTORC2. While mTORC1 inte-\ngrates inputs from nutrients and growth factors and coordinates cellular growth and  metabolism23–25; mTORC2 \nis activated by growth factor signals only and responds by phosphorylating the C-terminal hydrophobic motif of \nAkt/PKB on serine  47317,26–29. As such, mTOR complexes and their downstream targets are actionable proteins \nand metabolic targets in managing type 2 diabetes and mediate mTOR central role in glucose and energy metabo-\nlism and in pancreatic progenitor cell growth. Dysregulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes is linked to \ninsulin resistance and type 2 diabetes via several reciprocal mechanisms in animal models and cell  culture30–41. \nHowever, the causal association of mTOR pathways with diabetes is difficult to establish using observational \nstudies in humans, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) would be expensive. The Mendelian Randomization \n(MR), instrumental variable analysis using genetic variants, provides unbiased and unconfounded estimates by \ntaking advantage of the randomization during meiosis and  conception42. Studies in animal models and cell cul-\nture document a biphasic response of mTOR on glucose and energy  metabolism16,40,41,43,44. Recently, studies in the \nconditional knockout mice found that loss of mTORC1 impairs pancreatic beta-cell mass and functions as well \nas the cap-dependent protein  translation45,46. Therefore, we hypothesized that the elevated levels of circulating \nproteins of the downstream signals of mTORC1 could be protective from type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nIn this study, we investigated whether the risk of type 2 diabetes varied with EIF4EBP2, EIF-4E, EIF-4G, EIF-\n4A, and RP-S6K levels using the Mendelian Randomization approach. We hypothesized that mTOR downstream \neffectors are metabolic targets in managing type 2 diabetes due to the mTOR central role in glucose and energy \nmetabolism and in the pancreatic progenitors’ cell growth.\nSubjects and methods\nStudy design and participant flowchart.

The phenoScanner database contains curated large scale GWAS data \nand facilitates phenome scans, and genotype–phenotype associations across databases to link SNPs with disease \nbiology and mechanistic  pathways51,52.

We inputted the specific SNPs associated \nwith circulating protein levels of interest to determine the associations with disease traits.\nStatistical  analysis.  We  assessed  the  strength  of  the  genetic  instruments  from  the  F-statistic  using  an \napproximation, an F-statistics > 10 makes weak instrument bias unlikely (Supplemental Table 2)53. To obtain the \nMR estimates, we used a meta-analysis of SNP-specific Wald estimates from inverse variance weighting (IVW) \nwith multiplicative random  effects54–57. The SNPs were aligned based on the allele letter and allele frequency. The \nWald estimate was calculated as the ratio of the estimate for SNPs on diabetes divided by the estimate for SNPs \non exposure for each exposure, i.e., RP-S6K, EIF4EBP2, EIF-4E, EIF-4A, and EIF-4G. SNPs were excluded if they \nwere not in the 1,000 Genomes catalog. We corrected for multiple comparisons by using Bonferroni correction. \nMendelian Randomization (MR-Base) R package version 3.6.1 was used in the  analysis58.\nSensitivity testing.  For the IVW estimate to be valid, all the SNPs should be valid instruments. To establish \nthe validity of the SNPs as genetic instrumental variables (IV), we used the following tests: a weighted median \nand MR-Egger  estimates59. The weighted median provides correct estimates when SNPs accounting for > 50% of \nthe weight are  valid60. MR-Egger adapts the IVW analysis by allowing a non-zero intercept. This balance would \nallow for the detection of an unbiased causal effect, even if the IV2 assumption was violated. To test for hetero-\ngeneity, we used the Cochrane Q statistic, as well as  I2, which is calculated as 100% × (Q − df)/Q, where Q is \nCochran’s Heterogeneity statistics, and df is the degrees of  freedom61.\nMR-Egger can give an accurate estimate when the assumption of independent effects are satisfied and that \nthere is little evidence of the pleiotropic effects of SNPs on the outcome (Supplemental Figures 1–3). In addition, \nif MR-Egger does not correct for unknown pleiotropy, we also used MR-PRESSO, which detects and corrects \nfor  outliers62,63.\nWe used the R package \"clump_data\" to obtain independent SNPs, and the R Package \"Mendelian Randomi-\nzation\" and MR-PRESSO to obtain MR estimates.

For the genetic prediction of diabetes outcomes, we applied these SNPs \npredicting the exposures to publically available genetic associations with diabetes from the DIAGRAM case \n(n = 26,676) and control (n = 132,532) study (mean age 57.4 years). We used the R packages \"clump_data\" to \nobtain independent SNPs.\nOf the 94 SNPs predicting RP-S6K, 78 correlated SNPs were excluded, with the remaining 16 SNPs that \nare uncorrelated were included in the analysis. Of the 49 SNPs predicting EIF4EBP2, 37 correlated SNPs were \nexcluded, giving 12 independent SNPs. Of the 64 SNPs predicting EIF-4E, 48 correlated SNPs were excluded, \nleaving 16 independent SNPs; of the 38 SNPs predicting EIF-4G, 32 correlated SNPs were excluded, resulting \nin 6 independent SNPs. Finally, of the 86 SNPs predicting EIF-4A, 75 correlated SNPs were excluded, yielding \n11 independent SNPs (Fig. 2).\nTable 1 shows that EIF-4E cap-dependent translation factor circulating level was associated with a lower risk of \ntype 2 diabetes with an odds ratio (OR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (0.88, 0.99, p = 0.03) with similar estimates \nfrom the weighted median and MR-Egger. Protein concentrations were measured using the SOMAscan  assay47. \nProtein concentrations were quantified as relative fluorescent units. Similarly, EIF-4A cap-dependent translation \nfactor was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes with an odds ratio (OR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval \n(0.85, 0.97, p = 0.0003). The estimates were very similar in sensitivity analysis, although the MR-Egger estimate \nhad wide confidence intervals.\nEIF-4G3 and EIF4EBP2 were not associated with diabetes with odds ratio (OR) 1.08, 95% confidence inter-\nval (0.97, 1.19, p = 0.169), and odds ratio (OR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (0.86, 1.03, p = 0.09), respectively. \nSimilarly, ribosomal protein S6K was not associated with diabetes, OR 0.95, 95% confidence interval (0.89, 1.01, \np = 0.08). Sensitivity analysis gave consistent estimates.\nThe following 16 Independent SNPs were associated with EIF-4E circulating protein level (Table 2) and the \nharmonized outcomes were characterized, as shown in Fig. 4A. Similarly, we identified 11 independent SNPs \nassociated with EIF-4A circulating levels and associated with protective effects from the risk of diabetes (Table 2). \nWe leveraged the use of the PhenoScanner v2 curated database of human genotype–phenotype associations based \non cataloging GWAS publically available data from over 150 million unique SNPs and 65 billion associations \nhttps ://www.pheno scann er.medsc hl.cam.ac.uk51,52. Out of the 16 SNPs variants genetically associated with EIF-\n4E, twelve SNPs were located in the intron region of the following genes, RP11-266A241, AGBL1, LINCO2133, \nNLRP12 (3 SNPs), MARCO, ALK, PR11-138117.1, SPOCK3, RP11-434D9.1, CNGB3; also, three SNPs were \nlocated in the intergenic region of MIR4675, ACOO77851, and RLP7L1P4; and one SNP was located upstream \nof IZUMO3 gene. Most of the SNPs had no known disease associations. However, only three SNPs were associ-\nated with NLRP12, a marker of monocytes, and macrophages mediated inflammasome. \nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to leverage MR to determine the causal association of EIF-4E and EIF-\n4A circulating levels with diabetes mellitus in humans. The data suggest that higher circulating levels of EIF-4E \n(OR 0.94, CI [0.88, 0.99]) and EIF-4A (OR 0.90, CI [0.85, 0.97]) translation initiation proteins may be causally \nassociated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. As shown in the leave-one-out sensitivity IVW analysis, \nthe effect size for EIF-4E is − 0.06 (OR 0.94), and for EIF-4A is − 0.10 (OR 0.90) (Supplemental Figure 2). Per \nour study objectives, five mTORC1 downstream targets (RP-S6K, EIF4EBP2, EIF-4G3, EIF-4E cap-dependent \ntranslation, and EIF-4A cap-dependent translation factor), circulating levels were instrumented by strongly \nassociated SNPs (Fig. 5). This unbiased MR approach found that EIF-4E and EIF-4A, which are essential for \n5′-cap-dependent mRNA translation, could have a causal protective association with type 2 diabetes. The direc-\ntionality of the MR association between circulating levels of EIF-4E and EIF-4A, mTORC1-dependent proteins, \nand type-2 diabetes mellitus was protection, i.e., higher circulating levels of EIF-4E and EIF-4A may be caus-\nally associated with decreased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This data is consistent with experimental data in \nmTORC1 knockout mice showing an essential role of mTORC1 in beta cell functions and insulin  processing45. \nScientific RepoRtS  |        (2020) 10:15737  | \nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71987-8\n5"},{"page":6,"text":"Odds ratio\n95% confidence \ninterval\np-value\nCochran’s Q statistic \n(p-value)\nIntercept p-value\nMR-Egger\nExposure\nEIF-4E\nEffect size\nEIF-4A\nEffect size\nEIF-4G3\nEffect size\nEIF4EBP2\nEffect size\nRP-S6K\nMendelian \nrandomization \nmethod\nInverse variance \nweighted\nWeighted median\nMR-Egger\nMR PRESSO (uncor-\nrected)\nInverse variance \nweighted\nWeighted median\nMR-Egger\nMR PRESSO (uncor-\nrected)\nInverse variance \nweighted\nWeighted median\nMR-Egger\nMR PRESSO (uncor-\nrected)\nInverse variance \nweighted\nWeighted median\nMR-Egger\nMR PRESSO (uncor-\nrected)\nInverse variance \nweighted\nWeighted median\nMR-Egger\nMR PRESSO (uncor-\nrected)\n0.94\n0.91\n0.93\n0.94\n0.90\n0.90\n0.91\n0.90\n1.08\n1.08\n0.92\n1.08\n0.96\n1.00\n1.20\n0.96\n0.95\n0.93\n0.92\n0.95\n0.88, 0.99\n0.84, 0.98\n0.83, 1.05\n0.90, 0.98\n0.85, 0.97\n0.82, 0.98\n0.80, 1.05\n0.87, 0.94\n0.97, 1.19\n0.95, 1.24\n0.70, 1.20\n0.99, 1.17\n0.88, 1.05\n0.90, 1.12\n0.98, 1.48\n0.88, 1.05\n0.89, 1.01\n0.85, 1.00\n0.82, 1.04\n0.89, 1.01\n0.027\n8.397 (0.906)\n0.009\n–\n0.003\n2.662 (0.988)\n0.0002\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n0.018\n0.265\n0.017\n0.211\n0.169\n0.252\n0.540\n0.973\n0.080\n0.061\n0.194\n0.154\n–\n0.372\n16.75 (0.115)\n0.391\n–\n0.077\n18.747 (0.225)\n8.392 (0.867)\n0.944\n83.4%\n2.628 (0.977)\n0.853\n88.3%\n1.819 (0.7)\n0.213\n51.3%\nI2\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n89.5%\n–\n18.492 (0.185)\n0.660\n0.097\n–\n–\n10.917 (0.364)\n0.021\n0.6%\nTable 1.

Mendelian Randomization (MR-Base) R \npackage version 3.6.1 was used in the analysis.\nOur data indicated that the risk of diabetes varied with mTOR downstream target EIF-4E and EIF-4A, but not \nwith RP-S6K or EIF4EBP2. The association for both EIF-4E cap-dependent translation factor and EIF-4A were \nrobust to Bonferroni correction.\nIn this study, we used the two-sample MR, which increases the sample size and provides unconfounded esti-\nmates. However, MR requires several stringent assumptions to be fulfilled. First, the genetic predictors should \nbe strongly associated with the exposures (IV1); to satisfy this assumption, we selected only the SNPs strongly \nassociated with EIF-4E, EIF-4A, EIF-4G, EIF4EBP2, and RP-S6K circulating plasma levels. Second, no confound-\ners of the genetic instrument on outcome should exist, which we assume from genetic randomization at concep-\ntion (IV2). The underlying genetic studies were controlled for population stratification when necessary. Third, \ngenetic predictors of exposure should not be independently associated with diabetes (IV3), and only mediate \ntheir effects via the relevant exposure. In other words, there is little evidence of pleiotropy. Sensitivity analyses \nwith different assumptions about pleiotropy gave estimates with the IVW (Fig. 5). Since this study only used \naggregate summary statistics, we were not able to assess differences by age, gender, or other factors. However, \ncausal effects are generally expected to act consistently.\nScientific RepoRtS  |        (2020) 10:15737  | \nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71987-8\n6"},{"page":7,"text":"Chr:position

Association of genetically predicted mTOR-downstream targets exposures with diabetes outcome \nSNPS. Association between genetically determined EIF-4E, EIF-4A, EIF-4G, EIF4EBP2, and RP-S6K, mTOR \ndownstream targets with Diabetes health outcome. The data source for exposure is the human plasma \nproteomics–GWAS INTERVAL study (n = 3,301) participants from publically available aggregate summary \n data47. The source for diabetes health outcome is DIAGRAM database (DIAbetes Genetics Replication \nAnd Metaanalysis case (n = 26,676), and control (n = 132,532); https ://www.diagr am-conso rtium .org/. For \nsensitivity analysis, we used uncorrelated SNPs for EIF-4E, IF-4A, EIF-4G, EIF4EBP2, and RP-S6K. Mendelian \nRandomization (MR-Base) R package was used in the analysis.\nIn contrast to RCTs, MR studies inform the role of a specific causal pathway but do not reveal whether an \nintervention will be efficient. Furthermore, RCTs only report the effects of short-time exposures, while MR \nstudies usually identify the lifetime exposures. The limitations of the MR study are those cohort populations \nrecruited for the exposure (INTERVAL Study), and outcomes (DIAGRAM Study) were from European descent, \nwhich may limit the generalizability of the results to other populations.\nCell culture and animal studies have documented an integral role of mTORC1 in glucose metabolism and \n diabetes24,25,67–70. Blandino-Rosano and colleagues have shown in Raptor, a mTORC1 specific partner, in a condi-\ntional knockout mouse model led to pancreatic β-cell failure due to defects in insulin secretion and cell prolifera-\ntion, and thus furthered the development of  diabetes44–46,71,72. Ardestani and colleagues reported that mTORC1 \npositively regulates beta-cell growth and proliferation, thus promoting insulin secretion, while the hyperactiva-\ntion of mTORC1 led to beta-cell failure in type 2  diabetes16. Similarly, Tuo and Xiang reported a paradoxical \nrole of mTORC1 on insulin secretion and β-cell  metabolism31. The biphasic response of pancreatic β cells to \nmTORC1 activation has also been reported in  mice43. Shigeyama and colleagues found that ablated Tuberous \nSclerosis Complex 2 (TSC2), an upstream inhibitor of mTORC1m in mice (βTSC−/− mice), led to an initial \nincrease in β cell mass and size in an mTOR-dependent manner. Furthermore, the mice were hyperinsulinemic \nand hypoglycemic. However, after 40 weeks of age, these mice became hypoinsulinemic and hyperglycemic due \nto a reduction in β cell mass and  number43. Taken together, these two observations suggest that mTOR-mediated \na biphasic response on insulin secretion.\nSimilarly, a biphasic insulin sensitivity to mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, has been reported in C2C12  myocytes37. \nReciprocal regulation and cross-talk between mTORC1 and mTORC2 have been  suggested35,73. Further, a distinc-\ntive role of mTORC2 in regulating insulin secretion and pancreatic β cell functions has also been  reported18,35. \nBlandino-Rosano and colleagues found that the deletion of EIF-4EBP2 induced feedback and elevated glucose \ntolerance by increasing pancreatic beta-cell mass in knockout  mice74. It is possible that EIF-4E and EIF-4A may \nregulate the mRNA translation of insulin protein, insulin receptor, or the enzymes involved in the regulation of \nglucose metabolism such as those regulating glycolysis and TCA cycle. We leveraged the use of the PhenoScanner \ncurated database to explore possible causal mechanistic associations between the circulating levels of EIF-4E and \nEIF-4A and type 2 diabetes mellitus. We found 3 EIF-4E proxy SNPs namely, rs11084300, rs3848582, rs62143198, \nand 4 EIF-4A predicting SNPs, namely, rs3859507, rs11084300, rs34436714, rs146117463, that are associated \nwith the NLRP12 gene. The NLPR12 is an inhibitory innate immune sensor and a marker of monocytes and \nmacrophage inflammasomes.
