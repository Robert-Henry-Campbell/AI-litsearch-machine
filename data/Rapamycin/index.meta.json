However, the role of mTORC1 downstream proteins, including ribosomal protein S6K (RP-S6K), eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (EIF4EBP), eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (EIF-4G), eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (EIF-4E), and eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (EIF-4A), in regulating cataract development is still unknown. Herein, we conducted a mendelian randomization (MR) study to understand the function of mTORC1 signaling in the process of cataract development. Results The causal estimate was evaluated with inverse-variance weighted (IVW) estimate, weighted median estimator, MR-Egger and MR robust adjusted profile score (MR. RAPS). The single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), P<5 × 10− 6 and r2<0.05, were selected to genetically predict the RP-S6K, EIF4EBP, EIF-4E, EIF-4A, and EIF-4G. We included a total of 26,758 cases and 189,604 controls in this MR study. The study revealed causal association between circulating EIF4EBP (OR 1.09, 95% confidence interval 1.03,1.16, P = 0.004), RP-S6K (OR 1.04, 95% confidence interval 1.01, 1.08, P = 0.02) and cataract formation with IVW estimate. Whereas after correcting outliers, MR robust adjusted profile score (MR. RAPS) shows consistent result with IVW for EIF4EBP (OR = 1.08, 95%CI:1.05–1.11, P = 0.007). The observation strengthened the confidence in the true causal associations. However, no association was found for circulating EIF-4E (OR 1.03, 95% confidence interval 0.97, 1.09, P = 0.31), EIF-4A (OR 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.98, 1.07, P = 0.34), and EIF-4G (OR 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.94, 1.01, P = 0.64) levels with cataract formation. No evidence of heterogeneity and unbalanced horizontal pleiotropy was detected. Conclusion The MR study suggests that EIF4EBP is a high-risk factor for cataract development. There may be a potential causal association between the mTORC1/EIF4EBP axis and cataract. This research highlights the potential mechanism for cataract development and a genetic target to prevent as well as treat cataracts.

Introduction Cataract is one of the common causes of visual impair- ment and blindness in developing and developed coun- tries [1–3]. Although the phacoemulsification application is available worldwide, over 12 million people are blind because of cataract until 2010 [1, 4]. Moreover, no effec- tive pharmacological strategy exists to prevent the devel- opment of cataract. Several signaling molecules and pathways take part in modulating the development of cataract, including the mechanistic target of rapamy- cin (mTOR) [5], endoplasmic reticulum stress[6], and advanced glycation end products [7] et al. Of note, the mTOR signal pathway plays a critical regulating role in the occurrence and development of cataract by regulat- ing cellar processes such as cell growth, autophagy, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [8–10]. In mammals, mTOR can combine with different pro- teins and generate different complexes, including the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex1 (mTORC1) and the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex2 (mTORC2) [11]. mTORC1 plays an important role in Fig. 1 Main protein of mTORC1 signal pathway (mTORC1 is comprised by mTOR, Deptor, mLST8, Raptor, PRAS40. mTORC1 regulates cell function almost through phosphorylating the downstream protein of mTORC1, including PR-S6K and EIF4EBP. After getting phosphorylated by mTORC1, PR-S6K activates EIF-4B, which positively regulates EIF-4F. RP-S6K also phosphorylates and promotes the degradation of PDCD4, which is the inhibitor of EIF-4B. EIF4EBP is a repressor of EIF-4E, once phosphorylated by mTORC1, it dissociate with EIF-4E, and then promotes the assembly of EIF-4F complex. The EIF-4F complex is composed by EIF-4E, EIF-4G, and EIF-4A. The specificity repressor of mTORC1-rapamycin can combine with mTOR, and induce conformational change in mTORC1.

The regulation of mTORC1 functions is primarily through phosphory- lating the downstream targets, including ribosomal pro- tein S6K kinase 1 (PR-S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding proteins (EIF4EBPs) (Fig. 1) [14].

RP-S6K1 also phosphorylates and promotes the degradation of PDCD4, which is the inhibi- tor of EIF-4B [19]. EIF4EBP is a repressor of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (EIF-4E). Once phosphor- ylated by mTORC1 in multiple sites, it dissociates with EIF-4E, then promotes the 5’cap-dependent translation and assembling of the EIF-4F complex. The EIF-4F com- plex is composed of EIF-4E, EIF-4G, and eukaryotic ini- tiation factor 4A (EIF-4A) (Fig. 1) [12]. Rapamycin binds with FKBP12, a part of mTOR, and forms a FKBP12-rapamycin complex (Fig. 1). Subse- quently, the complex induces mTOR conformational change[20]. mTORC1 is sensitive to the nanomolar con- centration of rapamycin within one hour of exposure, whereas mTORC2 requires a more prolonged exposure and a higher dose [21]. The change of conformation in mTOR causes the disruption between mTOR and Raptor in mTORC1 [21]. Meng et al. [8] observed that rapamy- cin can effectively impair EMT in lens epithelial cells, thus inhibiting the process of cataract. At the same time, Ping et al. [9] treated cataract zebrafish with rapamycin and discovered the mitigation effect of cataract. Consid- ering the special role of rapamycin in regulating cataract, we speculated that mTORC1 signaling might affect cata- ract formation. Mendelian randomization (MR) is an analytic approach for assessing the causal association between poten- tially modifiable exposures, defined as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and the clinically relevant out- come [22]. Compared with randomized controlled trials (RCTs)-the gold standard to establish the causal associa- tion, MR utilizes the data from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Thus, MR study is more time-effective and contains a larger sample size. More- over, sometimes RCTs cannot be conducted as they are costly, impartial, and even unethical[23]. In our study, we conducted a MR study by leveraging the extensive Euro- pean population-based GWAS summary statistic data of mTORC1-related protein in plasma, including the con- centration of RP-S6K, EIF4EBP, and the EIF-4F compo- nents, like EIF-4E, EIF-4A, EIF-4G. In addition, we also Page 3 of 11 studied the causal effect of mTORC1-related circulating protein levels on cataract formation. the reliability of MR results, we removed SNPs with palindromes.

Eth- ical approval of each study can be found in the original publications. These studies were conducted with the ethi- cal guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki. Data sources for MR analyses Data sources for exposure The genetic variants of mTORC1-dependent pro- tein in plasma were obtained from the publicly avail- able proteomics-GWAS INTEVAL study (https://www. included 3622 phpc.cam.ac.uk/ceu/proteins/), which plasma proteins from 3301 healthy volunteers [24]. The INTEVAL study lasted from mid-2012 to mid-2014 and recruited blood donors over 18 years old from 25 centers of England’s National Health Service Blood and Trans- plant (NHSBT) [25]. The protein concentration was mea- sured by a multiplexed, aptamer-based approach-Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamers (SOMAscan assay). This approach helps analyze lower detectable protein con- centrations than traditional methods [26, 27]. It uses the modified single standard DNA SOMAmers to bind with protein targets quantified through DNA microarray [28]. The protein abundances were quantified as relative fluo- rescent units [24]. The genome-wide associations were obtained from the relative protein abundances after natural log-trans- formed, then adjusted for age, sex, time costing on blood collection, multi-dimensional scale according to popula- tion structural with linear regression, and genetic asso- ciation[24]. To obtain sufficient SNPs and estimate the accurate result, we obtained genome-wide significantly − 6) and independently (R2<0.05) SNPs to pre- (P<5 × 10 dict mTORC1-dependent protein in plasma [29–32], including RP-S6K, EIF4EBP, EIF-4G, EIF-4E, and EIF-4A, from the proteomics-GWAS INTEVAL study. To ensure Data sources for the outcome The association of outcome relative SNPs with cataract were obtained from the FinnGen study [33] (https:// r5.finngen.fi/). This study defined cataract by H25 of the International Classification of Disease-10 (ICD-10). The genotype data of the FinnGen research project was from Finnish biobanks and digital health record data from Finnish health registries. The 5th data was released in the first quarter of 2020 with a total sample size of 260,405. The individuals with ambiguous gender, high genotype missingness (> 5%), excess heterozygosity (± 4SD), and non-Finnish ancestry were excluded. Finally, 26,758 cases and 189,604 controls of Finnish descent were included in this study. Assessment of assumptions The MR study fulfilled the three core assumptions (Fig. 2) [34] :(1) The IVs must be associated with RP-S6K, EIF- 4EBP, EIF-4G, EIF-4E and EIF-4A. (2) The genetic instrument must not be associated with confounders, conditional on the exposure-outcome relationship.

(3) There should be no association between genetic instru- ments and cataracts except through EIF-4E, EIF-4A, EIF- 4G, EIF4EBP, and RP-S6K. We tested assumptions (2) (3) by the heterogeneity and pleiotropy test. We tested het- erogeneity with Cochrane’s Q value. The pleiotropy was divided into vertical and horizontal pleiotropy accord- ing to the pathways which SNPs influence the traits[35]. Considering vertical pleiotropy never violates the MR assumption and does not cause bias[36], we only tested the horizontal pleiotropy with the MR Egger regression intercept and MR-PRESSO. Sensitivity analysis To test and correct for horizontal pleiotropy and examine the robustness of the MR estimates, we applied the value of intercept in MR-Egger regression and mendelian random- ization pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) [37]. The intercept value in the MR-Egger regression was equivalent to the magnitude of unbalanced pleiotropic[38]. We also applied the MR-PRESSO to test and correct for the outlier in the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) estimate [37]. This approach included three components: global test, outlier test, and distortion test [37]. MR-PRESSO removes SNPs that were questioned and refitted other SNPs in the IVW regression, and then estimates the causal effect again [37]. The result of the causal estimate is unbiased even if outliers are up to 50% [37]. To test for the heterogene- ity, we used Cochrane’s Q value. For the robustness of the MR estimate, we applied the leave-one-out approach to test whether any single SNPs drove the estimate.

Statistical method “TwoSampleMR” packages were used to obtain the MR estimate in the R software (version1.4.1717). The SNPs were aligned by the allele letter and frequency. We used IVW to obtain the MR estimates. In case of no evidence for horizontal pleiotropy, and weak instruments, the IVW was used to obtain an overall estimate using a formula with the meta-analysis method of Wald estimates. The formula is the ratio of the gene‐outcome association and the gene‐exposure association of each exposure. [39] Weight median (WM) estimator[40] and MR-Egger [38, 41] were used to further analyze MR results. The WM estimator provided a consistent estimate when over 50% of the weight came from valid IVs [40]. Unlike IVW, the MR-Egger allows for little evidence of a violation of the IV3 assumption (instrumental variable assumption 3), which means permitting a low degree of evidence of the pleiotropic effects and still obtaining an unbiased causal estimate. However, it consumes statistical power [41]. Therefore, it is generally believed that the results of IVW are the most meaningful when passing the sensitiv- ity analysis [42–44]. Robust Adjusted Profile Score (MR. RAPS) was calculated for the causal estimate to provide higher statistical power, despite the existence of many Page 5 of 11 weak instrumental variables [45]. A circle map was used to visualize the result, which combined the MR estimate of all valid SNPs and the meta-analysis of MR estimate. The MR results were described by odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI). P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results MR estimate of RP-S6K After excluding SNPs having linkage disequilibrium, out- line, or palindromic sequence, 15 SNPs were included to predict RP-S6K genetically (Supplementary Table 1). The overall estimate calculated with IVW revealed the higher genetically predicted RP-S6K significance causal association with cataract. However, after correcting out- liers, MR. RAPS results showed no significant causal association. Additionally, MR-Egger and weight median showed no association between the RP-S6K and cataract (Table 1). All the SNPs which were genetically predicting RP-S6K are shown on Fig. 3. MR estimate of EIF4EBP After quality control, 10 SNPs were obtained to predict EIF4EBP (Supplementary Table 1). IVW showed that EIF4EBP was positively associated with cataract, and the result of MR. RAPS was similar (Table 1), which strengthened the confidence of the true causal associa- tions[46]. Meanwhile, the association remained direc- tionally consistent in weight median, whereas MR-Egger showed no association between mTORC1-dependent protein level of EIF4EBP with cataract (Table 1).

The MR study suggests the Page 8 of 11 positive direct association between plasma protein level of EIF4EBP (OR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.03–1.16, P = 0.004) and the risk of cataract in a combined sample of 26,758 cases and 189,604 controls. However, this study provided no evidence for the association of genetically determined RP-S6K, EIF-4E, EIF-4A, and EIF-4G with the onset of cataract. Moreover, sensitivity analyses did not show suf- ficient evidence of unbalanced pleiotropy and heteroge- neity, which indicates the MR estimate was independent and robust. With aging, LECs undergo numerous biochemical and biophysical changes, which induces structural and func- tional impairment, leading to EMT development and autophagy activation[47]. Previous studies have indicated that mTORC1 possibly promotes the development of cataract through controlling cellular EMT and inhibiting the level of autophagy through related signaling proteins. However, the involvement of the downstream protein in the mTORC1 signal pathway is not proven. As a critical process in cataract development, EMT is responsible for the trans-differentiation of lens epithelial cells (LECs) into mesenchymal cells. Its occurrence activates the mesenchymal phenotypes, which is related to enhanced migratory capacity, the process increases the production of extracellular matrix compo- nents [16, 48]. As a result, LECs lose their normal struc- ture, transdifferentiate into elongated spindle-shaped myofibroblasts, and migrate across the lens capsule, caus- ing cataract formation [48]. Zhang et al. [10] observed decreased cell proliferation and mobility upon specifi- cally inhibiting mTOR in LECs with siRNA. Besides, the function of mTORC1 was decreased, while the EMT level on LECs was inhibited significantly. Furthermore, Meng et al. pointed out that activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis initiates the process of EMT in human lens epithelial B-3 cells [49]. The study demonstrated that activation of the mTOR pathway with the phosphorylation EIF4EBP promotes the development of cataract, which was consis- tent with our results.

The study demonstrated that activation of the mTOR pathway with the phosphorylation EIF4EBP promotes the development of cataract, which was consis- tent with our results. [49]. invasiveness, and On the other hand, autophagy is an important factor in regulating cataract evolution. Autophagy is a highly con- served process that involves the degradation of senescent macromolecules and organelles of LECs to maintain lens transparency [49]. Autophagy is the early response to the internal environment disturbance induced by oxidative stress, like starvation, hypoxia, deficiency of growth fac- tors and over-activation. When encountered with stress, autophagy gets up-regulated, making LECs adapt to a new balance. After achieving homeostasis, the autophagy level decreases [9]. Similarly, a previous study observed that amino acid deprivation induces the activation of autophagy, and the process is regulated by mTORC1[50]. Ping and collages[9] reported that ablation of Gja8b in zebrafish causes severe defects in organelle degradation, inducing defective autophagy in LECs and inhibiting the degradation of senescent macromolecules, leading to cataract formation. After being treated with rapamycin, autophagy was promoted in LECs in a dose-dependent manner causing mitigation of cataract. Several conjec- tures exist for regulating proteins related to EIF4EBP and mTORC1 to control autophagy. The transcription factor FOXO activates EIF4EBP to active autophagy/lysosome system in reducing muscle aging in Drosophila. This sys- tem can degrade damaged protein to reduce the accumu- lation of metabolic stressors [51]. Except autophagy and EMT respective functions in the formation of cataract, they are also reported to interact with each other. For instance, autophagy induction could promote EMT in cardiac fibrotic disease [52], whereas autophagy could contribute to the attenuation of EMT in chronic renal fibrosis[53]. Sun et al. [54] discovered that autophagy inhibition attenuates the EMT process in New Zealand white rabbit LECs, triggered by the TGF-β2/ Smad signaling pathway. Therefore, part from autophagy and EMT respective functions in formation of cataract, their interaction may play a critical role in the formation process of cataract. Therefore, their interactions need to be studied further. In the current study, we observed that EIF4EBP was positively associated with cataract. Whereas RP-S6K, EIF-4E, EIF-4G, and EIF-4A were not significantly associ- ated with cataract. Similar to our study, Zhang et al. [55] compared RNA from age-related cataracts and normal lens epithelia using the semiquantitative RT-PCR method and observed no difference between cataract and normal LECs on EIF-4E levels. We speculate that these proteins may be involved in other signaling pathways. RP-S6k exists in different signal pathways, while S6K/PP1α/B-Raf can activate MAPK in PI3K/AKT signaling in regulating prostate cancer cell migration and invasion[56]. Besides, the EIF-4F complex can also be regulated by protein, except for the classical mTOR related molecule, like PDCD4[57]. PDCD4 is a tumor suppressor and can bind with EIF-4A to limit the available content to form EIF- 4F. EIF-4F components can be regulated apart from EIF- 4EBP, promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) has been associated with inhibiting the mRNA nuclear export role of EIF-4E [58]; EIF4A3 can combine with RNA-binding motif 8A (RBM8A), Mago homolog (MAGOH), and other auxiliary proteins, and form an exon junction com-","chunk_id":"Cai et al. - 2022 - Association of mTORC1‑dependent circulating protein levels with cataract formation a mendelian rand_8","doi":"Cai et al. - 2022 - Association of mTORC1‑dependent circulating protein levels with cataract formation a mendelian rand"},{"text":"a tumor suppressor and can bind with EIF-4A to limit the available content to form EIF- 4F.

In conclusion, according to this MR study, the plasma concentration of mTORC1-depended EIF4EBP promotes the onsetting of cataract on genetic level. Its regulating function may Page 9 of 11 be governed through the mTORC1/EIF4EBP axis. How- ever, we speculate that other potential signaling pathways may regulate these proteins and affect the concentration of RP-S6K, EIF4F components in plasma. Of note, we could not detect the association between cataract and RP-S6K, EIF4F components. Therefore, our study shows that the EIF4EBP is a vital protein associated with cata- ract. However, further research is required to explore the mTORC1/EIF4EBP axis, the downstream protein of this signaling including RP-S6K and EIF4F components, in the process of cataract formation. There were some limitations to this present study. Firstly, considering the data source from the GWAS meta- analyses statistic data of mTOR-dependent circulating protein and cataract were restricted in individuals with European ancestry, we are unclear whether this finding can be applied to other populations. Thus, more sources of data are required to detect the effect on another eth- nicity. Secondly, although sensitivity analysis results showed no evidence of unbalanced pleiotropy, part of balanced pleiotropy may exist. Thirdly, more detailed information on the subtype of cataracts has not been available until now. Therefore, further research on the association between mTOR-dependent protein level and subtype of cataracts is required. Fourthly, some research- ers indicated that the GWAS only incorporated 3301 individuals because of the expensive measuring technol- ogy of plasma protein[31]. Thus, the database cannot detect as many genome-wide significant genetic variants as possible. A more relaxed IV selection threshold might balance between feasibility of the study and statistical power. Additionally, some scholars chose the IV selection − 6 rather than the commonly used threshold to be P<5e − 8 to obtain sufficient SNPs GWAS significance level P<5e and to estimate more accurate results [29–31]. Therefore, − 6 we set a more relaxed IV selection threshold to be P<5e rather than the commonly used GWAS significance level − 8. Fifthly, there are three isoforms for EIF4EBP, of P<5e including EIF4EBP1, EIF4EBP2 and EIF4EBP3[61]. EIF- 4EBP1 is abundant in adipose tissue, pancreas, and skel- etal muscle, EIF4EBP2 is ubiquitously expressed[62], and EIF4EBP3 distributes highest in skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, and pancreas[63]. Compared with EIF4EBP1, EIF4EBP2 gets phosphorylated at lesser residues[61], has a binding preference with EIF4F [61], and has a more effective blockade by rapamycin[64]. Considering the wide distribution and function of EIF4EBP2, it might play a more","chunk_id":"Cai et al. - 2022 - Association of mTORC1‑dependent circulating protein levels with cataract formation a mendelian rand_9","doi":"Cai et al. - 2022 - Association of mTORC1‑dependent circulating protein levels with cataract formation a mendelian rand"},{"text":"EIF- 4EBP1 is abundant in adipose tissue, pancreas, and skel- etal muscle, EIF4EBP2 is ubiquitously expressed[62], and EIF4EBP3 distributes highest in skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, and pancreas[63].

Considering the wide distribution and function of EIF4EBP2, it might play a more critical role in the cataract formation than other two isoforms. At the same time, due to the limitation of the database, we could only incorporate EIF4EBP2 in this study. Further research is needed to test the interaction and regulation between these isoforms. Lastly, although this study provided a credible signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of cataracts, more experimental laboratory data is warranted to verify its feasibility. Conclusion This unbiased two-sample MR study supports the causal positivity association between circulating EIF4EBP levels and cataract formation. Furthermore, using the in-vitro and in-vivo data of the previous studies, our results sug- gested the critical role of the mTORC1/EIF4EBP axis in the mechanism of cataract, regardless of cataract sub- types. However, further studies are required to verify this pathway to explore the detailed functional relevance and downstream proteins of the axis and to further investi- gate its clinical utility. Nevertheless, the finding of this study will provide the basis for a more efficient phar- macological target in the prevention and treatment of cataracts.

Background: Most previous studies supported that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is over-activated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and exacerbates the development of AD. It is unclear whether the causal associations between the mTOR signaling-related protein and the risk for AD exist. Objective: This study aims to investigate the causal effects of the mTOR signaling targets on AD. Methods: We explored whether the risk of AD varied with genetically predicted AKT, RP-S6K, EIF4E-BP, eIF4E, eIF4A, and eIF4G circulating levels using a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis. The summary data for targets of the mTOR signaling were acquired from published genome-wide association studies for the INTERVAL study. Genetic associations with AD were retrieved from the International Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project. We utilized the inverse variance weighted as the primary approach to calculate the effect estimates. Results: The elevated levels of AKT (OR = 0.910, 95%CI=0.840-0.986, p = 0.02) and RP-S6K (OR = 0.910, 95%CI=0.840- 0.986, p = 0.02) may decrease the AD risk. In contrast, the elevated eIF4E levels (OR = 1.805, 95%CI=1.002-1.174, p = 0.045) may genetically increase the AD risk. No statistical signiﬁcance was identiﬁed for levels of EIF4-BP, eIF4A, and eIF4G with AD risk (p > 0.05). Conclusion: There was a causal relationship between the mTOR signaling and the risk for AD. Activating AKT and RP-S6K, or inhibiting eIF4E may be potentially beneﬁcial to the prevention and treatment of AD.

Cai et al. / Causal Association Between mTOR-Dependent Protein Levels INTRODUCTION Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a typical neurode- generative disease characterized by morbidity and cognitive impairment in elderly people [1]. It makes up 60%–80% of all dementia cases [1], affecting over 50 million people worldwide [2]. Given the high prevalence and heavy economic burden, exploring more detailed pathogenesis to help reduce the risk of AD is urgently required [3].

Given the high prevalence and heavy economic burden, exploring more detailed pathogenesis to help reduce the risk of AD is urgently required [3]. Amyloid-(cid:2) (A(cid:2)) pep- tide and neuroﬁbrillary tangles (NFTs) formed by hyperphosphorylated tau have been regarded as the major pathological markers of AD [4]. These pro- tein affect dendritic integrity and lead to the death of nerve cells by interrupting the connections between nerve cells [4, 5]. Various targets and pathways par- ticipate and stimulate the composition of A(cid:2) and tau, including the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling-related pathway [6]. mTOR, an atypical serine/threonine protein kinase, regulates several essential mammalian cell functions [7]. The mTOR signaling pathway has been repeat- edly reported to participate in nervous system disease, especially AD. Additionally, mTOR complexes exist in two main multiprotein complexes, mTOR complex 1 and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC1 and mTORC2) [8] (Fig. 1). Both the upstream regulation and down- stream outputs of mTORC1 are being more studied and well discussed compared with mTORC2 in AD [9]. Importantly, mTORC1 was more activated in the AD brains instead of mTORC2 by detecting levels of mTOR/p-mTOR and its downstream targets in autopsied brain hippocampal tissues obtained from AD patients [10]. Our study mainly focuses on the upstream and downstream targets of mTORC1 for the reason that they can contribute to messenger RNA translation and protein synthesis of A(cid:2) and tau [7]. Numerous studies have made the relationships between upstream and downstream targets of mTOR and their interaction relatively straightforward [11]. mTORC1 is activated by growth factors, energy metabolism, nutrients and stress [12]. The phospho- inositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/ protein kinase B (AKT) pathway plays a vital role in transmitting growth fac- tors (Insulin, IGF) signals to mTORC1 by regulating the phosphorylation of TSC1/2. The downstream tar- gets of mTORC1 are unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1), transcription factor EB (TFEB), ribosomal protein S6 kinases (RP-S6K), and eukaryotic translation ini- tiation factor 4E-binding protein (EIF4E-BPs). The former two are crucial protein for autophagy. ULK1 is a crucial part of the macroautophagy initiation complex. TFEB regulates the expression of lysoso- mal biogenesis and autophagy. Activating mTORC1 can restrain autophagy by phosphorylating ULK1 and TFEB [13]. The latter two play essential roles in the regulation of translation, which will be primarily dis- cussed in this study. The activated mTORC1 activates RP-S6K, further controls cell growth via promot- ing ribosome biogenesis, and activating several key factors in translation [14]. EIF4E-BPs, composed of EIF4E-BP1, 2, and 3, isolate eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and prevent assembling eIF4F complex, further inhibiting translation initia- tion and protein synthesis [15]. Only when mTORC1 inhibits EIF4E-BPs and then dissociated eIF4E com- bines with eIF4G and eIF4A to assemble the eIF4F complex can it mediates the recruitment of ribosomes to mRNA during translation [16]. Accordingly, the activated mTOR leads to the activation of RP-S6K and inhibition of EIF4E-BP, resulting in protein syn- thesis (Fig. 1). At present, the causal associations between mTOR and AD are still debated. Hence, our study focuses on exploring the causal","chunk_id":"Cai et al. - 2023 - Causal Association Between mTOR-Dependent Protein Levels and Alzheimer’s Disease A Mendelian Random_1","doi":"Cai et al. - 2023 - Causal Association Between mTOR-Dependent Protein Levels and Alzheimer’s Disease A Mendelian Random"},{"text":"com- bines with eIF4G and eIF4A to assemble the eIF4F complex can it mediates the recruitment of ribosomes to mRNA during translation [16].

At present, the causal associations between mTOR and AD are still debated. Hence, our study focuses on exploring the causal association of mTOR path- ways with AD through an approach called Mendelian randomization (MR) because randomized controlled trials and observational studies are difﬁcult to estab- lish and prone to confounding, reverse causation, and various biases [17]. MR is a valuable and efﬁcient way to detect unbiased causal effects [17]. A valid approach is to choose SNPs as instrumental variables (IVs) to mimic the randomized allocation of individ- uals to the exposure and thus, ensure comparability of groups any confounder. Besides, genetic variants of exposure are not subject to reverse causation as they are randomly allocated [18]. In this study, we investigated the six target levels of mTORC1 (AKT, RP-S6K EIF4E-BP, eIF4E, eIF4A, and eIF4G) using the MR approach to explore the causal relationships between these protein and AD. METHODS Genetic predictors of plasma RP-S6K, EIF4E-BP, eIF4E, eIF4A, and eIF4G Genetic predictors of the data about mTOR- related gene exposure were retrieved from a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) of results of the human plasma proteome from the INTER- VAL study with 3301 healthy individuals of European descent (mean age 43.7 years, 48.9% females) [19] (Supplementary Table 1). The study performed the H.-Y. Cai et al. / Causal Association Between mTOR-Dependent Protein Levels 1479 Fig. 1. Upstream and downstream regulations of mTOR and the function with AD. Both mTORC1 and mTORC2 are activated by growth factor and PI3K-dependent signaling. PI3K/AKT activates mTORC1 via inhibitory phosphorylation of TSC1/2. AKT serves as an essential connecting node, activating mTORC1 through PI3K signaling or downstream of mTORC2 activation. mTORC1 is hyperactive in AD in most previous studies, further inhibits autophagy initiation, and promotes ribosome biogenesis and mRNA translation through phosphorylation of the ULK, TFEB, RP-S6Ks, and EIF4E-BPs, respectively. Rapamycin can reduce the hyperactivity of mTORC1 and regulate mTORC1 in proper function. mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; AD, Alzheimer’s disease; ULK1, unc-51-like kinase 1; TFEB, transcription factor EB; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; RP-S6Ks, ribosomal protein S6 kinases; EIF4E-BPs, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein.

The cases were conﬁned to LOAD (onset at 65 years of age or older) as diagnosed by clinical assessment, MRI- or autopsy-conﬁrmed, and diagnoses from health care records. Selection of instrumental variables In our MR analysis, IVs need to meet three critical assumptions: 1) SNPs of mTOR were strongly associ- ated with AD; 2) SNPs of mTOR were independent of the confounders of mTOR and AD; 3) SNPs of mTOR were related to AD only via mTOR [17, 22]. We used all SNPs independently (r2 < 0.001) and signiﬁcantly (p < 5 × 10–6) predicting an exposure. F statistics were utilized to assure the strength of the SNPs [23]. If the F statistic was greater than 10, the SNPs selected were regarded as valid IVs, and results based on those ought not to suffer consid- erably from weak IVs [22]. Only the SNPs whose F statistics were more than 10 would be remained. The process of selection of IVs was presented in Fig. 2. Besides, to guarantee meeting the three basic assumptions above, we also analyzed in PhenoScan- ner (http://www.phenoscanner.medschl.cam.ac.uk/), a database involving comprehensive information on the connection of genotype and phenotype, to identify whether these SNPs were related with the possible 1480 H.-Y. Cai et al. / Causal Association Between mTOR-Dependent Protein Levels median, were used to increase the IVW estimates despite being less efﬁcient (wider CIs) [30]. Sensitivity analysis consisted of assessing the het- erogeneity and pleiotropy and leave-one-out analysis. Detecting underlying pleiotropy and the heterogene- ity for MR estimates were severely important in MR studies. Firstly, we conducted Cochran’s Q test to check the heterogeneity representing potential hor- izontal pleiotropy [31]. This was a weighted sum of the squared distances of the variant-speciﬁc esti- mates from the overall IVW estimate. Additionally, we implemented MR-Egger regression to detect and determine whether there remained some violations of the standard IVs assumptions [32]. Moreover, the intercept obtained from the MR-Egger regres- sion can be an indicator for assessing directional pleiotropy, which could inﬂuence causal estimates [33]. Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESid- ual Sum and Outlier methods (MR-PRESSO) were used to detect and correct directional pleiotropy [34]. The leave-one-out analysis evaluated the effect of outlying and pleiotropic genetic variants [33]. Given the 6 MR estimates, a Bonferroni-corrected p-value below 0.008 (0.05/6) was considered signiﬁ- cant, and p < 0.05 was regarded nominally signiﬁcant. Results were presented in odd ratios (ORs) and 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) per genetically predicted standard deviation (1-SD) unit increase in each tar- get.

Results for potential pleiotropy and heterogeneity assessments of mTOR- dependent protein levels with the risk of AD were shown in Supplementary Table 8. As for crucial upstream targets of mTOR, AKT was found a causal effect on the risk of AD (IVW: Fig. 2. A ﬂow diagram showing the process of instrumental vari- ants selection.

Statistical analysis We eliminated SNPs with incompatible alleles in the exposure and the outcome. For instance, an SNP would be removed if the effect/non-effect alleles for exposure and outcome were A/G and A/C [29]. After harmonizing the GWAS datasets of mTOR signal- ing pathway-associated targets and AD, we utilized several MR methods from TwoSampleMR packages (version 0.5.6) in R software (version 4.0.5) to esti- mate the causal effects of the six upstream and downstream targets of mTOR on AD.

DISCUSSION Through performing 2SMR analysis, our study estimated causal relationships between several mTOR-related targets and the risk for AD. Speciﬁ- cally, AKT and RP-S6K were protective factors of AD, and eIF4E was identiﬁed as a risk factor for AD, whereas EIF4E-BP, eIF4G, and eIF4A were of no signiﬁcance. Our study, for the ﬁrst time, used a 2SMR method to reveal the possible causal rela- tionships between mTOR and AD from the selected GWAS data. Our ﬁndings were consistent with recent reports and support the causal association of these targets, especially AKT, RP-S6K, and eIF4E, with the risk of AD. EIF4-BP, eIF4A, and eIF4G are also vital targets in the mTOR signaling in the main- 1482 H.-Y. Cai et al. / Causal Association Between mTOR-Dependent Protein Levels Fig. 4.

The amyloid cascade hypothesis, NFTs, and neu- roinﬂammatory have been the three main foci of AD research. We investigated how mTOR inﬂuences the abnormal development of A(cid:2) oligomers, tau pro- tein phosphorylation, and nervous inﬂammation in AD patients. In most studies, abnormally upregulated mTOR signaling in AD can drive the synthesis of A(cid:2) and tau, decreasing the clearance of these pro- tein [11]. Meanwhile, it is indicated that elevated A(cid:2) deposits, in turn, hyperactivate mTOR, which hyper- phosphorylated tau, forming NFTs [36]. A(cid:2) deposits and NFTs lead to nerve inﬂammation and further blood-brain barrier impairment, where mTOR sig- naling also acts as an essential factor [37, 38]. Upper regulators like PI3K/AKT signaling axis play a crucial role in AD patients. We found that AKT could lower the risk of AD, which was consistent with previous studies. In some experi- ments, PI3K/AKT is involved in many signaling pathways delaying the progression of AD, such as PI3K/Akt/Nrf2/HO-1 [39], PI3K/Akt/GSK-3 (cid:2) [40], and PI3K/AKT/FoxO3a [41]. Via PI3K/AKT signal- ing axis, these experiments reduced oxidative stress, neurodegeneration, neuroinﬂammation and cognitive impairment in AD mouse/mice. Accordingly, AKT can be regarded as one of the treatment targets for AD. In our study, AD would be at a lower risk with higher levels of RP-S6K. Chiku et al. knocked down S6K of Drosophila homolog and found that the level of pSer262-tau increased. Their study indicated that activation of S6K signiﬁcantly decreased the levels of toxic tau and acted as a protective role in suppressing neurodegeneration [42]. However, in terms of previous mainstream studies, it seemed to increase the risk of AD. It has been reported that over-activating mTORC1 in AD activates RP-S6K, which upregulates excessive tau mRNA translation H.-Y. Cai et al. / Causal Association Between mTOR-Dependent Protein Levels 1483 [43]. Examination of brain tissue from AD patients revealed that phosphorylated S6K was associated with increased tau protein [44]. No matter how RP- S6K inﬂuences the development of AD, we conﬁrm that RP-S6K is genetically related to the risk of AD. As mentioned earlier, EIF4E-BP and its down- stream targets, involving eIF4E, eIF4A, and eIF4G, are essential indicators of mTORC1. We discovered a causal relationship between eIF4E and the risk for AD, though no causal associations of EIF4E- BP, eIF4G, and eIF4A were observed in AD. We found that eIF4E played a risk factor in the develop- ment of AD, which was in line with previous studies about the hypothesis of over-activation of mTOR. The mTOR signaling stimulates 4EBP1 phosphorylation and then leads to the formation of the eIF4F complex [45], which is positively correlated with total tau and p-tau [46].

MR is a relatively superior and convenient method for exploring the understanding of cause-and-effect relationships between disease and molecule targets, providing a probable reference for clinical trials. As we know, rapamycin, a mTORC1 inhibitor, is rela- tively well established in animal studies and proved effective for patients at the early age of AD. A phase I study of rapamycin is on the go (NCT042009). Sev- eral previous studies have reported that rapamycin and other methods of inhibiting mTORC1 effectively improve AD in different well-established mouse models of AD by reducing A(cid:2) levels [47], inhibit- ing the abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein [48], restoring brain functions for asymptomatic APOE4 carriers [49], clearing chronic nervous inﬂammation [50], and breaking the negative feedback mech- anism on insulin signaling to improve synaptic protein synthesis [51]. As we found, these three mTOR-dependent circulating proteins (AKT, RP- S6K, eIF4E) have causal effects on AD, arguably supporting the approach to AD therapy using mTOR as a therapeutic target. The current study still had several limitations. First, the GWAS dataset of EIF4E-BP mainly concerns 4E- BP2 because 4E-BP1-related GWAS data were not found. Most related studies were conducted with 4E- BP1, although 4E-BP2 could be the most abundant isoform. For example, 4E-BP2 was the most plentiful in the brain [14]. This was one of our most signiﬁ- cant limitations. Secondly, this study was based on genetic predictors of upstream and downstream pro- tein of mTOR whose correspondence with biological markers of AD. Given that the GWAS datasets about A(cid:2) and tau are hard to obtain, we did not analyze MR between pathological features of AD and mTOR- dependent protein levels. Thirdly, in spite of age having been adjusted in the original GWAS datasets papers [19, 21], the case of AD in IGAP is an older age group, which could cause selection bias [52]. Finally, because there were only a few SNPs selected through the conventional GWAS threshold (p < 5×10–8), we relaxed the threshold (p < 5×10–6) to obtain more IVs to perform MR analysis, as portrayed in other mTOR MR studies [53]. Conclusions Although further studies are needed to discover the detailed role of mTOR signaling-related targets in AD, our ﬁndings support a shared genetic background between mTOR signaling-related targets and the risk for AD. Activating AKT and RP-S6K, or inhibiting eIF4E may be potentially beneﬁcial to the prevention and treatment of AD.

However, most research is based on observa- tional studies, and the causality remains uncertain.

Osteoporosis (OP) is a progressive, age- related, systemic disease featured by the loss of bone mass, leading to increased risk of fractures and reduced quality of life. The prevalence of OP is on the rise globally due to an aging population. The mechanistic target-of-rapamycin (mTOR) regulates bone metabolism by promoting osteoblastic differentiation and increasing bone matrix synthesis. The association between mTOR and OP is largely based on observational studies, and causality remains uncertain. This study conducted a mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to explore the causal relationship between mTOR- dependent proteins and bone mineral density (BMD), a characteristic index of OP. What was learned from the study? MR analysis revealed a causal association between mTOR-dependent EIF-4E circulating protein and forearm (FA)- BMD, providing new insights into the underlying pathophysiology of OP. Moreover, the study suggested that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway may be a therapeutic target for OP. INTRODUCTION Osteoporosis (OP) is a progressive, age-related, systemic disease characterized by the loss of bone mass and the deterioration of bone microstructure, leading to an increased risk of fractures [1, 2]. Globally, OP prevalence is on the rise due to an aging population [3, 4]. Bone mineral density (BMD) is a measurable and powerful index for diagnosing OP in the clinical ﬁeld [5]. The WHO has established diagnostic criteria for osteoporosis by utilizing BMD T-scores. the Increasing evidence suggests that bone for- mation and resorption as well as osteoporosis treatment are affected by the mechanistic tar- get-of-rapamycin (mTOR) pathway [6]. mTOR is a serine-threonine protein kinase that partici- pates in the formation of two structural and functional complexes named mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) [7]. The mTOR is critical cellular signaling that plays an essential role in regulating cell prolif- eration, autophagy, and apoptosis by coordi- nating growth and metabolism of eukaryotic cells [7], which also serves as a reg- ulator of bone metabolism related to promoting osteoblastic differentiation and increasing bone matrix synthesis [8, 9]. Xu et al. [10] reported that activation of mTORC1 in B lymphocytes promotes osteoclast formation. The mTORC1, which contains mTOR, G protein b-unit-like protein, and regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor) [11], regulates two downstream factors called ribosomal protein-S6 kinase (RP- S6K) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein (EIF4E-BP). The EIF4E-BP is a negative regulator of the EIF-4F complex, which comprises three proteins (EIF-4A, EIF-4E, and EIF-4G). causality Although mounting evidence has empha- sized the essential role of mTOR in regulating bone homeostasis, remains the uncertain since they are based on observational studies. Therefore, to explore the causal associ- ation between mTOR and OP, we conducted a mendelian randomization analysis of BMD at four sites: femur, forearm, lumbar spine, and ﬁve mTOR-dependent calcaneus with Adv Ther (2023) 40:4987–4998 4989 circulating proteins: RP-S6K, 4EBP, EIF-4A,","chunk_id":"Cheng et al. - 2023 - Genetic Evidence Supporting a Causal Association Between mTOR-Dependent EIF-4E Circulating Protein L_1","doi":"Cheng et al. - 2023 - Genetic Evidence Supporting a Causal Association Between mTOR-Dependent EIF-4E Circulating Protein L"},{"text":"evidence has empha- sized the essential role of mTOR in regulating bone homeostasis, remains the uncertain since they are based on observational studies.

METHODS Data Sources In this study, BMD is regarded as a crucial index to evaluate the risk of osteoporosis. The fol- lowing genome-wide association study (GWAS) data were obtained from a meta-analysis pub- lished at genetic factors for osteoporosis con- sortium (GEFOS) in 2015 [12]: forearm bone mineral density (FA-BMD), femoral neck bone mineral density (FN-BMD), and lumbar spine bone mineral density (LS-BMD). For FA-BMD, 8143 individuals were included. Meanwhile, a total of 32,735 individuals for FN-BMD and 28,489 individuals for FA-BMD were evaluated. All of the participants were from European populations. Based on sex, weight, age, and age squared, BMD was adjusted. Summary statistics for estimated heel bone mineral density (eBMD) were obtained from the IEU GWAS database [13], which contained 426,824 European par- ticipants, 55% of whom were female. We con- ﬁrmed these data from the publicly available GWAS catalog website (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ gwas/downloads/summary-statistics) [14]. For the data about mTOR-dependent circulating proteins, a proteomics-GWAS INTERVAL study involving 3301 participants was conducted, which included 3600 plasma protein assays [15]. The study was performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1964 and its for this later amendments. Patient consent study was not necessary because the study was non-interventional and data were de-identiﬁed. Selection of Instrumental Variables (IVs), (SNPs) instrumental variables As single-nu- cleotide polymorphisms related to circulating proteins were mTOR-dependent employed. These SNPs were strongly (p value 5 9 10–6) and independently (r2 \\ 0.001) linked with the three assumptions for MR analysis which included exposure, satisfying the the following: ﬁrst, a genetic variation is asso- ciated with a particular exposure; second, con- founding pathways are not affected by genetic variation in the outcomes; third, genetic varia- tion will not affect the results directly but only indirectly through exposure. To reduce the possibility of statistical bias in the original GWSA, SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of \\ 0.01 were excluded because of their low conﬁdence. SNPs with inconsistent alleles (e.g., T/C vs. T/G) and palindromic SNPs with ambiguous alleles (e.g., T/A vs. C/G) were har- monized by ﬂipping the outcome variants. To exclude the instrumental SNPs showing a strong and con- association with the outcomes founders, (http://www. phenoscanner.medschl.cam.ac.uk/phenoscann er) was utilized. The exposure-related instru- mental SNPs were then taken out of the out- come datasets. Finally, F-statistics was used to fulﬁll the relevance assumption, and F-statis- tics [ 10 was regarded as valid instruments. PhenoScanner the MR Analysis MR analysis was used to estimate the causative effect of exposure variables on the outcome. In this study, we evaluated the causal associations between mTOR protein (RP-S6K, 4EBP, EIF-4A, EIF-4E, and EIF-4G) and BMD at different skeletal sites (FA-BMD, LS-BMD, FN-BMD, and eBMD) based","chunk_id":"Cheng et al. - 2023 - Genetic Evidence Supporting a Causal Association Between mTOR-Dependent EIF-4E Circulating Protein L_2","doi":"Cheng et al. - 2023 - Genetic Evidence Supporting a Causal Association Between mTOR-Dependent EIF-4E Circulating Protein L"},{"text":"used to fulﬁll the relevance assumption, and F-statis- tics [ 10 was regarded as valid instruments.

In this study, we evaluated the causal associations between mTOR protein (RP-S6K, 4EBP, EIF-4A, EIF-4E, and EIF-4G) and BMD at different skeletal sites (FA-BMD, LS-BMD, FN-BMD, and eBMD) based on the summary statistics (b coefﬁcients and standard errors). The MR anal- ysis we used were inverse variance weighting (IVW), MR-Egger regression, and weighted median (WM). These MR methods were detailed in published studies [16, 17]. Among these methods, IVW is the most important for esti- mating the causal effect between exposure and outcome [18]. When there is no directional pleiotropy (p for MR-Egger intercept [ 0.05) among the instrumental SNPs, the IVW method was considered the most reliable [19]. The MR analyses were performed with the R language and environment using the TwoSampleMR package [20]. We used the odds ratio (95% conﬁdence interval) to express the estimated effect value, which can be recorded as per 1-SD 4990 Adv Ther (2023) 40:4987–4998 increment in each mTOR protein with the odds ratio (OR) of OP. Causality Between mTOR Protein and OP Sensitivity Analysis Due to the absence of the assumption of pleio- tropy in MR, the following sensitivity analysis was performed to verify the reliability of the analysis. First, Cochran’s Q statistics were applied to assess the IVs’ heterogeneity. Second, MR-Egger regression was used to determine whether the selected IVs had pleiotropic effects. Whether horizontal pleiotropy affects the results of MR analysis using the intercept term from MR-Egger regression was evaluated [21]. in MR-Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Third, Outlier (MR-PRESSO) analysis, a causal effect estimate was reduced by removing SNPs related to heterogeneity. Finally, we used leave-one-out validation to assess each IVs’ sensitivity. Funnel plots were used to evaluate the heterogeneity among SNPs as well. RESULTS SNP Selection As mentioned earlier, we selected independent SNPs (r2 \\ 0.001, p \\ 5 9 10-6) associated with the exposure. Fifteen SNPs were extracted as signiﬁcant predicted SNPs of RP-S6K. Fifteen SNPs were extracted as signiﬁcant associated SNPs of 4EBP. Sixteen SNPs were selected as substantial predicted SNPs of EIF-4E. Nine SNPs were identiﬁed as signiﬁcant predicted SNPs of EIF-4G. Ten SNPs were considered signiﬁcant indicating SNPs of EIF-4A (Fig. 1). The mean F-statistic ranged from 28.02 to 52.69, which is above the standard cutoff indicating sufﬁcient instrumental strength. SNP-speciﬁc information is reported in Supplementary Tables. As a result, those signiﬁcant SNPs of mTOR protein were eventually used as IVs for the MR analysis. ([ 10) In the two-sample MR analysis, the level of EIF- 4E had a strong causal relationship with FA- BMD (OR = 0.938, 95% CI 0.887, 0.991, p = 0.024) according to the IVW (Fig. 2A). However, RP-S6K, 4EBP, EIF-4A, and EIF-4G showed no causal relationship with FL-BMD, LS- BMD, FA-BMD, or eBMD in different MR methods (p [ 0.05) (Fig. 2B–D, Table 1).

EIF-4E was causally associated with FA-BMD according to IVW analysis. Regarding sensitiv- ity, no directional pleiotropy was evident in the MR-Egger ﬁnding (intercept = 0.010, p = 0.59). No single SNP strongly inﬂuenced causality between EIF-4E and FA-BMD in the leave-one- out analysis (Fig. 3). Based on the symmetry of the funnel plots, our study strictly adhered to the IV assumptions (Supplementary Figures). Moreover, there was no evidence of hetero- geneity in IVW (Q = 9.723, p = 0.716). The remaining mTOR-dependent circulating pro- teins are shown in the Supplementary Figures. DISCUSSION In the present study, we identiﬁed causal asso- ciations of mTOR-dependent circulating pro- teins with various skeletal sites. The results indicated that a genetically higher level of EIF- 4E was positively associated with higher FA- BMD in the IVW analysis. In addition, we found no association between proteins (RP-S6K, 4EBP, EIF-4A, and EIF-4G) with FN-BMD, LS-BMD, and eBMD. As the elderly population grows, OP gradu- ally becomes a global health problem. The imbalance between bone resorption and for- mation results in a number of disorders including osteoporosis [22]. Bone resorption and osteoclast differentiation are regulated by autophagy-related biological processes [23]. Autophagy inhibition reduces the differentia- tion of osteoclast progenitors into osteoclasts and causes osteoclast dysfunction [24]. In addition, osteoblasts are formed by mesenchy- mal stem cells (MSCs) that undergo autophagy Inhibition of during bone formation [25]. osteocyte autophagy leads to aging-related OP Adv Ther (2023) 40:4987–4998 4991 Fig. 1 Schematic representation of MR.

The mTOR pathway is a crucial repressor of autophagy. Upstream signaling pathways including PI3K/AKT/mTOR mediate the inhibi- tion of autophagy induced by mTOR (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4, PI3K is activated by insulin, glucose, and cytokines, which phosphorylate PDK1 at Thr308, triggering protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation [27]. Alternatively, mTORC2 can also mediate the activation of AKT for its phosphorylation at Ser473 [28]. Activated AKT transfers to other cell compart- ments to activate various downstream sub- strates, and mTORC1 is a critical downstream branch [29]. Meanwhile, as a result of phos- phorylating AKT, mTORC1 is directly activated at Ser 2448 by phosphorylated mTOR [29]. 4992 Adv Ther (2023) 40:4987–4998 Adv Ther (2023) 40:4987–4998 4993 b Fig. 2 Risk of mTOR protein for genetically predicted osteoporosis.

Speciﬁcally, mTORC1 inhibits autophagy by phosphorylating ULK1 at serine 757 (ULK1-PS757) [30]. Therefore, mTOR may have been linked to the pathogenesis of OP. A previous clinical observation found that rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, could augment regulatory T cells (Tregs) [31], which were markedly reduced in patients with OP [32]. The immune effect of rapamycin may be associated with OP because of its regulation of Treg cells. The osteoclasts are key mediators of skeletal diseases, especially osteoporosis.

This signaling pathway is made up of a triad of RANKL RANK, and OPG, which are all members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF-) superfamily [33]. According to Choi and Arron [34] in 2000, bone resorption and T cells are related, and ‘‘bone immunology’’ is further deﬁned as the study of the relationship between bone resorption and T cells. The Th17 cells promote bone resorption in both direct and indirect ways. On the one hand, osteoclast precursors express RANKL [35], which leads to osteoclastic differentiation by binding to RANK [36]. Furthermore, the Th17 cytokines strongly induced RANKL expression [34]. On the other hand, IL-17 secreted by Th17 cells promotes RANKL expression in osteoclastogenesis-sup- porting cells, increasing bone resorption [37]. Treg cells can inhibit osteoclast formation by preventing RANKL expression [38]. It has been demonstrated that Treg cells impact bone mainly through a contact-dependent mecha- nism and an inhibitory cytokine-dependent mechanism [39]. In addition, either activation of intracellular effectors by Treg cells or TGF-b secreted by Treg can promote osteoblast prolif- eration and differentiation [40].

We found a causal relationship between EIF- 4E and FA-BMD, suggesting the mTOR pathway is a possible therapeutic target for OP. The EIF- 4E is a downstream target of mTORC1/4EBP. The mTORC1 controls the translation process through the phosphorylation of EIF4EBP. Unphosphorylated 4EBP binds to EIF-4E and inhibits the formation of translation initiation complex 4F (eIF4F) to prevent translation [41] (Fig. 4). Takashi Iezaki et al. [42] reported that the mTORC1/4EBP cascade regulates the trans- lation of NRA in undifferentiated mesenchymal cells, indicating the role of the mTORC1/4EBP axis in skeletal development. Currently, EIF-4E has been involved in tumorigenesis. It has been considered a potential therapeutic target in bone cancer [43, 44], but the study of EIF-4E in OP is still in its infancy. Results from our MR analyses suggested that the causal association between EIF-4E and FA-BMD may be related to the following factors shown in Fig. 4: ﬁrst, EIF- 4E serves an essential role in the PI3K/AKT/ 4994 Adv Ther (2023) 40:4987–4998 Fig. 3 MR leave-one-out sensitivity analysis for EIF-4E on osteoporosis.

Second, the mTORC1 inhibition downregulated the syn- thesis of Tregs by downregulated EIF-4E-depen- dent mRNA translation, thus destroying the homeostasis of the immune system [45]. Also, a deﬁciency of Tregs was found in patients with OP [46]. Prospective studies are required to conﬁrm the causal relationship between EIF-4E and OP. Although MR can strengthen causal infer- ence, it also has limitations. Since population stratiﬁcation affects the genotype-disease rela- tionship, our regression model adjusted for race. Notably, it did not inﬂuence the strength of the correlation. However, given that all the data we used were from European ancestry, the results can only be generalized to essentially healthy European adults. Second, two-sample MR anal- ysis requires non-overlapping samples between exposure and outcome GWAS, but we could not accurately estimate the overlap of the sampled copies. However, it is possible to minimize the bias associated with sample overlap using strong instruments.

RF is a pathological autoimmune response to throat infection with group A Streptococcus, which remain a public health problem in many low-income countries. However, the etiology and pathogenesis of RF are still unclear. MTOR is known to regulate cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Rapamycin is currently being developed to treat autoimmune diseases. The causality of mTOR on RF remained unknown, so this study aimed to investigate the causal effect of MTOR- dependent proteins in RF. What was learned from the study? By performing Mendelian randomization analysis, we found a causal relationship between a mTOR-related target (RP-S6K and ATG7) and RF risk, which is that higher circulating levels of RP-S6K may be causally associated with lower RF risk, and higher circulating levels of ATG7 may be associated with higher RF risk.These ﬁndings may provide new insights into the intervention of RF. INTRODUCTION Rheumatic fever (RF) is a pathological autoim- mune response to throat infection with group A Streptococcus (GAS) [1]. The illness is character- ized by various combinations of joint pain and swelling, cardiac valvular regurgitation with the potential for secondary heart failure known as rheumatic heart disease (RHD), chorea, subcu- taneous nodules, erythema marginatum, and fever [2, 3]. The mortality rate of RF and its sequel, RHD, is comparable to that of rotavirus, and about 50% of that of malaria [4]. There are approximately 471,000 cases of acute rheumatic (ARF) each year, and approximately fever 350,000 annual deaths as a result of ARF or RHD [2]. It is estimated to cause a USD2.2 trillion loss worldwide annually [5]. Thus, it is imperative to determine causal associations and to develop valid strategies to illustrate the pathogene- sis that can help reduce the risk of RF. of The mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine protein kinase in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase related kinase family that is the core catalytic component of two distinct protein complexes, known as mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) and 2 (mTORC2) [6, 7].The mTOR signaling controls various cel- lular processes, including apoptosis, autophagy, translation, energy metabolism, and inﬂamma- tion [8]. Therefore, the regulation of mTOR provides a new therapeutic strategy for various diseases. However, the role of mTOR in RF is still not fully clear. At present, rapamycin has achieved promis- ing progress inﬂammatory in alleviating autoimmune diseases, including mouse models of lupus and multiple sclerosis [9, 10].

Therefore, the regulation of mTOR provides a new therapeutic strategy for various diseases. However, the role of mTOR in RF is still not fully clear. At present, rapamycin has achieved promis- ing progress inﬂammatory in alleviating autoimmune diseases, including mouse models of lupus and multiple sclerosis [9, 10]. MTORC1 is a central hub of metabolic and inﬂammatory signaling, which initiates biosynthetic path- ways for cell growth and proliferation via phosphorylation of ribosomal S6K and eukary- otic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). It is also known to suppress autophagy, which is critical to pro- viding energy and molecular building blocks by recycling macromolecules in response to nutri- ent and environmental stress [11, 12]. However, the causality from mTOR on RF remains unknown. This study mainly explores the cau- sal relationship between mTOR and RF. Mendelian randomization (MR) is an ana- lytical approach that utilizes genetic variants, generally single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as instrumental variables for exposure to diminish confounding and reserve causality, thereby strengthening the causal inference of 1592 Adv Ther (2023) 40:1590–1600 inherent an exposure-outcome association, which can overcome confounding biases in observational studies. In this study, we investi- gated whether the risk of RF varied with pro- teins related to mRNA translation in mTORC1 signaling (EIF4EBP2, EIF-4E, EIF-4G, EIF-4A, and RP-S6K), and proteins associated with Inhibit- ing protein catabolism in mTORC1 signaling (ATG7). METHODS Genetic Datasets the exposure of Genetic prediction of the mTOR-related GWAS data was obtained from the publicly available INTERVAL study Pro- teomics GWAS data. The study quantiﬁed 3,622 plasma proteins in 3,301 healthy participants from the INTERVAL study in whom a SomaLo- gic aptamer-based plasma protein assay had been run [13]. https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/ ceu/proteins/ We applied the genetic predic- tors of mTOR downstream targets, namely EIF4EBP2, EIF-4E, EIF-4G, EIF-4A, RP-S6, and ATG7, to determine the causal association between mTOR-downstream targets and RF. The outcome dataset was obtained from the Integrative Epidemiology Unit GWAS database (https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk), which includes 38,209 cases and 156,711 healthy controls of European ancestry. The database was developed at the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit at the University of Bristol. This resource is a manually curated collection of complete GWAS summary datasets made available as open- source ﬁles for download. Selection of genetic instruments The exposure data with known genetic determi- nants are also called instrumental variables (IV) [14]. We applied the genetic predictors of mTOR downstream targets, namely EIF4EBP2, EIF-4E, EIF-4G, EIF-4A, RP-S6K, and ATG7, to determine the causal association between mTOR-down- stream targets and RF. Firstly, we chose SNPs that level reached a genome-wide signiﬁcance (p\\5 9 10–6), identifying the SNPs relevant to EIF4EBP2, EIF-4E, EIF-4G, EIF-4A, RP-S6K and ATG7. To prevent bias of results for strongly associated SNPs and to ensure that SNPs were valid and independent, the linkage disequilib- rium threshold for clumping was to R2\\0.001. We evaluated the strength of the gene instrument from the F-statistic using an approx- imate approach, excluding SNPs with F-statis- tic\\10 to eliminate weak instrument bias. set In addition, Phenoscanner (http://www. phenoscanner.medschl.cam.ac.uk/) analyzed a curated database of publicly available results from large-scale genetic association studies [15].","chunk_id":"Mu et al. - 2023 - Genetic Evidence Supporting Causal Roles of mTOR-Dependent Proteins in Rheumatic Fever A Two-Sample_2","doi":"Mu et al. - 2023 - Genetic Evidence Supporting Causal Roles of mTOR-Dependent Proteins in Rheumatic Fever A Two-Sample"},{"text":"to ensure that SNPs were valid and independent, the linkage disequilib- rium threshold for clumping was to R2\\0.001.

To see whether these SNPs were associated with potential risk factors, including smoking and drinking, we removed SNPs related to any potential confounders at genome-wide signiﬁ- cance (Fig. 1). Statistical Analyses We performed the MR analysis using the ﬁxed- effects inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method as the primary analysis to evaluate the causal associations between mTOR-downstream tar- gets and RF. This method provided the most robust causal estimates while being relatively the weighted sensitive to pleiotropy. Thus, median method, the MR-Egger regression, and the MR Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier method were further applied as supplementary analyses [16, 17]. Egger regression, a tool to detect slight study bias in meta-analysis, can be adapted to test for bias from pleiotropy. We further assessed the horizontal polytropic using the MR-Egger intercept test and leave-one-out analyses. Cochran’s Q test was also used to identify heterogeneity.

Autophagy Related Protein 7 1596 DISCUSSION By performing MR analysis, our study estimated the causal relationship between several mTOR- related targets and RF risk. The data suggest that higher circulating levels of RP-S6K may be cau- sally associated with lower RF risk, and higher circulating levels of ATG7 may be associated with higher RF risk, whereas EIF4EBP2, EIF-4E, EIF-4G, EIF-4A had no signiﬁcant correlation with RF. Our study is the ﬁrst to assess the risk between mTOR and RF using MR, and our ﬁndings reafﬁrm the possibility of mTOR in alleviating inﬂammatory autoimmune diseases. In our study, RP-S6K was a protective factor of RF.

Our study is the ﬁrst to assess the risk between mTOR and RF using MR, and our ﬁndings reafﬁrm the possibility of mTOR in alleviating inﬂammatory autoimmune diseases. In our study, RP-S6K was a protective factor of RF. RP-S6K, ribosomal protein S6 kinase, is a well-characterized target for mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation, which induces phosphoryla- tion and activation of S6 to stimulate protein translation [18, 19]. mTOR plays a profound role in T cell lineage development. Speciﬁcally, it refers to promoting Th17 cell differentiation by S6K1 and S6K2. Mechanistically, S6K1 impinges on the downregulation of Gﬁ1, a negative regulator of Th17 differentiation. At Adv Ther (2023) 40:1590–1600 the same time, S6K2 acts as a nuclear ‘‘carrier’’ for the transcription factor RORc required for Th17 differentiation [9, 20]. (Fig. 5) Thus, mTOR may regulate T-cell metabolism by acti- vating S6K and ultimately affect autoimmunity after Streptococcus infection. ATG7 is considered to be a risk factor for RF. ATG7 is a ubiquitin-like ligase that forms clas- sical bilayer-like autophagosomes, which play a vital role in the two ubiquitination modiﬁca- tions of autophagosomes formed by autophagic vesicles, occurring in the ATG5-ATG12 system and the LC3 system, respectively. Atg7 acts as E1 ubiquitin activase Atg12. Then, Atg12 is delivered to the E2 ubiquitin transferase Atg10. Finally, Atg12 binds to Atg5 to form a complex. After that, it is combined with Atg16L to form the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L complex on the autophagosome’s outer membrane, promoting the transfer of LC3 (Atg8) from Atg3 to the substrate phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE). LC3 includes two interconvertible forms, LC3-I and LC3-II, which are involved in autophagosome membrane formation. Atg7 acts as an E1 enzyme to mediate the coupling of LC3-I to the Fig. 5 a Signaling pathways downstream of mTORC1. b Schematic of the transformation of autophagic vesicles into autophagosomes.

MTOR is involved in the induction and initiation of autophagy [24]. Several recent studies have conﬁrmed that autophagy may be activated in mice inoculated with Streptococcus peptidoglycan polysaccharide, which appears to be consistent with increased expression of ATG7 autophagy initiation-related proteins. mTOR protein expression was lower in mice after rapamycin treatment than in mice vacci- nated peptidoglycan streptococcal polysaccharide [25]. In addition, Inomata et al. demonstrated that ATG7 is an essential com- ponent of the autophagy machinery, charac- terized by its independence from the members of the autophagic preinitiation complex. The occurrence of autophagy mediated by ATG7 has been observed in","chunk_id":"Mu et al. - 2023 - Genetic Evidence Supporting Causal Roles of mTOR-Dependent Proteins in Rheumatic Fever A Two-Sample_5","doi":"Mu et al. - 2023 - Genetic Evidence Supporting Causal Roles of mTOR-Dependent Proteins in Rheumatic Fever A Two-Sample"},{"text":"ATG7 autophagy initiation-related proteins. mTOR protein expression was lower in mice after rapamycin treatment than in mice vacci- nated peptidoglycan streptococcal polysaccharide [25]. In addition, Inomata et al. demonstrated that ATG7 is an essential com- ponent of the autophagy machinery, charac- terized by its independence from the members of the autophagic preinitiation complex. The occurrence of autophagy mediated by ATG7 has been observed in bone marrow-derived macro- phages of streptococcal-infected mice [26]. Therefore, due to the characteristics of the autophagy mechanism, it is hypothesized that ATG7 affects RF after streptococcal infection. with Currently, RF is mainly treated by timely and appropriate antibiotic therapy for streptococcal A infection. This study demonstrates a causal relationship between mTOR and RF. Therefore, it may provide new ideas for developing related target drugs. MTOR inhibitors are effective immunosuppressive drugs for the prevention of acute rejection after solid organ transplantation [27]. They affect transcription and protein syn- thesis by integrating various signaling stimuli, and ultimately regulate cell apoptosis, growth and autophagy. Scientists have linked mTOR to various disease processes, such as neoplasia, arthritis, insulin resistance, and osteoporosis. Due to their inhibitory effects on cell growth and metabolic signaling pathways, they have recently been developed as antitumor-targeted therapies for various cancers [28]. Currently, two mTOR inhibitors (temsirolimus and ever- olimus) have been approved by the US Food and the European Drug Administration and Medicines Agency for the oncology market [29]. Because S6K isoforms play an essential role in the development and progression of several diseases, S6K isoforms are often considered potential therapeutic targets [30]. PF-4708671 is the ﬁrst reported S6K1-speciﬁc inhibitor, which has only been reported to reduce the ﬁbrotic area and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes [31]. The majority of mTOR-targeted therapies have been attributed to the inhibition of translation, and treatments are currently being investigated at this level of unregulated protein synthesis. Moreover, natural product-derived small mole- cule pomiferin triacetate as a novel mTORC1/ C2 inhibitor has been identiﬁed to be effective at low micromolar concentrations and to efﬁ- ciently attenuate translation [32]. mTOR, as the master switch of cell metabolism, is an adequate target protein for anticancer drugs. Therefore, many mTOR inhibitors are used as anticancer drugs in the clinic. However, resistance may develop, so continuously developing new allosteric mTOR inhibitors is necessary. Due to the high molecular weight and more chiral carbon of mTOR inhibitors, it is not easy to synthesize them. In the future, we can start with structural modiﬁcation to improve their prop- erties, develop new drug formulations, and carry out the treatment of other diseases [33]. Our into the development of mTOR inhibitors for the treat- ment of RF. study also provides insights This study has several strengths. First, for the ﬁrst time, MR analysis was employed to explore the causality of mTOR with RF, which could vastly reduce the inﬂuence of the environmen- tal confounders and reverse causality, and be less prone to the bias of observational studies.

Soliman1* & C. Mary Schooling1,2 The mammalian Target of Rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) nutrient‑sensing pathway is a central regulator of cell growth and metabolism and is dysregulated in diabetes. The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (EIF‑4E) protein, a key regulator of gene translation and protein function, is controlled by mTORC1 and EIF‑4E Binding Proteins (EIF4EBPs). Both EIF4EBPs and ribosomal protein S6K kinase (RP‑S6K) are downstream effectors regulated by mTORC1 but converge to regulate two independent pathways. We investigated whether the risk of type 2 diabetes varied with genetically predicted EIF‑4E, EIF‑4A, EIF‑4G, EIF4EBP, and RP‑S6K circulating levels using Mendelian Randomization. We estimated the causal role of EIF‑4F complex, EIF4EBP, and S6K in the circulation on type 2 diabetes, based on independent single nucleotide polymorphisms strongly associated (p = 5 × 10–6) with EIF‑4E (16 SNPs), EIF‑4A (11 SNPs), EIF‑4G (6 SNPs), EIF4EBP2 (12 SNPs), and RP‑S6K (16 SNPs). The exposure data were obtained from the INTERVAL study. We applied these SNPs for each exposure to publically available genetic associations with diabetes from the DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta‑analysis (DIAGRAM) case (n = 26,676) and control (n = 132,532) study (mean age 57.4 years). We meta‑analyzed SNP‑specific Wald‑estimates using inverse variance weighting with multiplicative random effects and conducted sensitivity analysis. Mendelian Randomization (MR‑Base) R package was used in the analysis. The PhenoScanner curated database was used to identify disease associations with SNP gene variants. EIF‑4E is associated with a lowered risk of type 2 diabetes with an odds ratio (OR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (0.88, 0.99, p = 0.03) with similar estimates from the weighted median and MR‑Egger. Similarly, EIF‑4A was associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes with odds ratio (OR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (0.85, 0.97, p = 0.0003). Sensitivity analysis using MR‑Egger and weighed median analysis does not indicate that there is a pleiotropic effect. This unbiased Mendelian Randomization estimate is consistent with a protective causal association of EIF‑4E and EIF‑4A on type 2 diabetes. EIF‑4E and EIF‑4A may be targeted for intervention by repurposing existing therapeutics to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.

In 2015, it was estimated that 9.4% of the US population, or approximately 30.3 million people have diabetes1. Among those, only 23.1 million people are diagnosed, and about 7.2 million are undiagnosed. Type 2 diabetes represents approximately 90 to 95% of all diabetes cases. The estimated direct medical costs of diagnosed diabetes in 2017 was $237 billion in the US with an average medical expenditure of diagnosed person of $13,700 per year2. It is further estimated that 33.9% of US adults have prediabetes. To date, the causes of type 2 diabetes are not fully understood. Diabetes is also associated with multiple co-morbidities and complications, including obesity. Thus, there is an urgent need to determine causal associations and develop new strategies for prevention, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of type 2 diabetes. The mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase and a key regulator of cell growth and metabolism3–5. As such, mTOR protein is a central metabolic integrator and is dysregulated in type 2 diabetes and diabetes-associated co-morbidities6–8. Importantly, mTOR is a druggable protein and therefore is a potential target for type 2 diabetes interventions. It nucleates two functionally-distinct and mutually-exclusive complexes, namely mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2). Both mTORC1 and mTORC2 regulate cellular metabolism, survival, proliferation, and growth. mTORC1 is a central hub for nutrient-sensing and energy metabolism and, as such, coordinates anabolic protein and nucleotide synthesis and catabolic autophagy9–16. On the other hand, mTORC2 drives insulin signaling by phosphorylating Akt (Ser473)/PKB downstream of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/insulin pathway17–20. The mTORC1, which binds exclusively to Raptor protein and other partners (Fig. 1), regulates two down- stream effectors, namely, Ribosomal Protein-S6 kinase 1 (RP-S6K 1) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein (EIF4EBP). The first mTORC1 target, RP-S6K1 phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initia- tion factor 4B (EIF-4B), which is a positive regulator of EIF-4F complex21. In addition, RP-S6K also phospho- rylates the programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4), which is a negative regulator of EIF-4A and targets it to degradation via the ubiquitin pathway22. The second mTORC1 downstream target, EIF4EBP, is a repressor of the translation initiation complex (EIF-4F), which is required for 5′cap-dependent translation of mRNA (Fig. 1). Once phosphorylated by mTORC1, EIF4EBP dissociates from EIF-4E, allowing for the assembly of the EIF-4F complex and initiation of 5′cap-dependent translation. The EIF-4F complex consists of EIF-4E, EIF-4G, and EIF- 4A. EIF-4E binds to 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5′-UTR of eukaryotic mRNA and mediates the recruitment of mRNA on ribosomes to start protein translation. As mentioned earlier, the mTOR kinase attracts different protein partners to generate two functionally distinct complexes, namely, mTORC1 and mTORC2.

As mentioned earlier, the mTOR kinase attracts different protein partners to generate two functionally distinct complexes, namely, mTORC1 and mTORC2. While mTORC1 inte- grates inputs from nutrients and growth factors and coordinates cellular growth and metabolism23–25; mTORC2 is activated by growth factor signals only and responds by phosphorylating the C-terminal hydrophobic motif of Akt/PKB on serine 47317,26–29. As such, mTOR complexes and their downstream targets are actionable proteins and metabolic targets in managing type 2 diabetes and mediate mTOR central role in glucose and energy metabo- lism and in pancreatic progenitor cell growth. Dysregulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes is linked to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes via several reciprocal mechanisms in animal models and cell culture30–41. However, the causal association of mTOR pathways with diabetes is difficult to establish using observational studies in humans, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) would be expensive. The Mendelian Randomization (MR), instrumental variable analysis using genetic variants, provides unbiased and unconfounded estimates by taking advantage of the randomization during meiosis and conception42. Studies in animal models and cell cul- ture document a biphasic response of mTOR on glucose and energy metabolism16,40,41,43,44. Recently, studies in the conditional knockout mice found that loss of mTORC1 impairs pancreatic beta-cell mass and functions as well as the cap-dependent protein translation45,46. Therefore, we hypothesized that the elevated levels of circulating proteins of the downstream signals of mTORC1 could be protective from type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this study, we investigated whether the risk of type 2 diabetes varied with EIF4EBP2, EIF-4E, EIF-4G, EIF- 4A, and RP-S6K levels using the Mendelian Randomization approach. We hypothesized that mTOR downstream effectors are metabolic targets in managing type 2 diabetes due to the mTOR central role in glucose and energy metabolism and in the pancreatic progenitors’ cell growth.

Mendelian Randomization (MR-Base) R package was used in the analysis. tein concentrations were measured using the SomaLogic method. This SomaScan proteomic assay utilizes a pro- tein-capture Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer (SOMAmer). The SOMAmer reagents have dual characteristics as protein-affinity binding agents and unique nucleotide sequences recognized by DNA probes for quantification, which enhances the sensitivity of the proteomic assay48. Protein concentrations were quantified as relative fluo- rescent units47. The initial INTERVAL study recruited 45,264 healthy blood donors who were 18 years or older and were eligible to donate blood within 25 National Health Service (NHS) Blood and Transplant Centers in England49,50. The trial was registered under # ISRCTN24760606, and recruitments were conducted from June 2012–June 2014. We used the publically available datasets. As mentioned above, in this study, we obtained single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which strongly (p-value 5 × 10–6), and independently (r2 < 0.05) predicted RP-S6K, EIF4EBP2, EIF-4E, EIF-4A, and EIF-4G Scientific RepoRtS | (2020) 10:15737 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71987-8 3 Figure 3.

PhenoScanner curated database. The phenoScanner database contains curated large scale GWAS data and facilitates phenome scans, and genotype–phenotype associations across databases to link SNPs with disease biology and mechanistic pathways51,52. We used the PhenoScanner to link the identified SNPs in the current study with possible mechanistic pathways of type 2 diabetes mellitus. We inputted the specific SNPs associated with circulating protein levels of interest to determine the associations with disease traits. Statistical analysis. We assessed the strength of the genetic instruments from the F-statistic using an approximation, an F-statistics > 10 makes weak instrument bias unlikely (Supplemental Table 2)53. To obtain the MR estimates, we used a meta-analysis of SNP-specific Wald estimates from inverse variance weighting (IVW) with multiplicative random effects54–57. The SNPs were aligned based on the allele letter and allele frequency. The Wald estimate was calculated as the ratio of the estimate for SNPs on diabetes divided by the estimate for SNPs on exposure for each exposure, i.e., RP-S6K, EIF4EBP2, EIF-4E, EIF-4A, and EIF-4G. SNPs were excluded if they were not in the 1,000 Genomes catalog. We corrected for multiple comparisons by using Bonferroni correction. Mendelian Randomization (MR-Base) R package version 3.6.1 was used in the analysis58. Sensitivity testing. For the IVW estimate to be valid, all the SNPs should be valid instruments. To establish the validity of the SNPs as genetic instrumental variables (IV), we used the following tests: a weighted median and MR-Egger estimates59. The weighted median provides correct estimates when SNPs accounting for > 50% of the weight are valid60. MR-Egger adapts the IVW analysis by allowing a non-zero intercept. This balance would allow for the detection of an unbiased causal effect, even if the IV2 assumption was violated. To test for hetero- geneity, we used the Cochrane Q statistic, as well as I2, which is calculated as 100% × (Q − df)/Q, where Q is Cochran’s Heterogeneity statistics, and df is the degrees of freedom61. MR-Egger can give an accurate estimate when the assumption of independent effects are satisfied and that there is little evidence of the pleiotropic effects of SNPs on the outcome (Supplemental Figures 1–3).

We conducted secondary analysis from publically available aggregate summary data with no involve- ment of the participants in the primary studies. No original data were generated from this manuscript. Ethical approval of each of the studies used is available in the original publications. There is no required IRB for the sec- ondary analysis of summary data. This study follows the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki 1975. Results As mentioned earlier, for genetic prediction of exposure, we obtained SNPs that strongly and independently predicted RP-S6K, EIF4EBP2, EIF-4E, EIF-4A, and EIF-4G circulating plasma levels from a GWAS of 3,301 participants in the INTERVAL study47. For the genetic prediction of diabetes outcomes, we applied these SNPs predicting the exposures to publically available genetic associations with diabetes from the DIAGRAM case (n = 26,676) and control (n = 132,532) study (mean age 57.4 years). We used the R packages \"clump_data\" to obtain independent SNPs. Of the 94 SNPs predicting RP-S6K, 78 correlated SNPs were excluded, with the remaining 16 SNPs that are uncorrelated were included in the analysis. Of the 49 SNPs predicting EIF4EBP2, 37 correlated SNPs were excluded, giving 12 independent SNPs. Of the 64 SNPs predicting EIF-4E, 48 correlated SNPs were excluded, leaving 16 independent SNPs; of the 38 SNPs predicting EIF-4G, 32 correlated SNPs were excluded, resulting in 6 independent SNPs. Finally, of the 86 SNPs predicting EIF-4A, 75 correlated SNPs were excluded, yielding 11 independent SNPs (Fig. 2). Table 1 shows that EIF-4E cap-dependent translation factor circulating level was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes with an odds ratio (OR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (0.88, 0.99, p = 0.03) with similar estimates from the weighted median and MR-Egger.","chunk_id":"Soliman and Schooling - 2020 - Causal association between mTOR-dependent EIF-4E and EIF-4A circulating protein levels and type 2 di_5","doi":"Soliman and Schooling - 2020 - Causal association between mTOR-dependent EIF-4E and EIF-4A circulating protein levels and type 2 di"},{"text":"6 independent SNPs.

Similarly, we identified 11 independent SNPs associated with EIF-4A circulating levels and associated with protective effects from the risk of diabetes (Table 2). We leveraged the use of the PhenoScanner v2 curated database of human genotype–phenotype associations based on cataloging GWAS publically available data from over 150 million unique SNPs and 65 billion associations https ://www.pheno scann er.medsc hl.cam.ac.uk51,52. Out of the 16 SNPs variants genetically associated with EIF- 4E, twelve SNPs were located in the intron region of the following genes, RP11-266A241, AGBL1, LINCO2133, NLRP12 (3 SNPs), MARCO, ALK, PR11-138117.1, SPOCK3, RP11-434D9.1, CNGB3; also, three SNPs were located in the intergenic region of MIR4675, ACOO77851, and RLP7L1P4; and one SNP was located upstream of IZUMO3 gene. Most of the SNPs had no known disease associations. However, only three SNPs were associ- ated with NLRP12, a marker of monocytes, and macrophages mediated inflammasome. Discussion To our knowledge, this is the first study to leverage MR to determine the causal association of EIF-4E and EIF- 4A circulating levels with diabetes mellitus in humans. The data suggest that higher circulating levels of EIF-4E (OR 0.94, CI [0.88, 0.99]) and EIF-4A (OR 0.90, CI [0.85, 0.97]) translation initiation proteins may be causally associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. As shown in the leave-one-out sensitivity IVW analysis, the effect size for EIF-4E is − 0.06 (OR 0.94), and for EIF-4A is − 0.10 (OR 0.90) (Supplemental Figure 2). Per our study objectives, five mTORC1 downstream targets (RP-S6K, EIF4EBP2, EIF-4G3, EIF-4E cap-dependent translation, and EIF-4A cap-dependent translation factor), circulating levels were instrumented by strongly associated SNPs (Fig. 5).

Nature 201847). Protein concentrations were quantified as relative fluorescent units. The data shows that EIF-4E cap-dependent translation factor was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes with an odds ratio (OR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (0.88, 0.99, p = 0.03) with similar estimates from the weighted median and MR-Egger. Similarly, EIF-4A cap-dependent translation factor was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes with an odds ratio (OR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (0.85, 0.97, p = 0.0003). The estimates were very similar in sensitivity analysis, although the MR-Egger estimate had wide confidence intervals. Mendelian Randomization (MR-Base) R package version 3.6.1 was used in the analysis. Our data indicated that the risk of diabetes varied with mTOR downstream target EIF-4E and EIF-4A, but not with RP-S6K or EIF4EBP2. The association for both EIF-4E cap-dependent translation factor and EIF-4A were robust to Bonferroni correction. In this study, we used the two-sample MR, which increases the sample size and provides unconfounded esti- mates. However, MR requires several stringent assumptions to be fulfilled. First, the genetic predictors should be strongly associated with the exposures (IV1); to satisfy this assumption, we selected only the SNPs strongly associated with EIF-4E, EIF-4A, EIF-4G, EIF4EBP2, and RP-S6K circulating plasma levels. Second, no confound- ers of the genetic instrument on outcome should exist, which we assume from genetic randomization at concep- tion (IV2). The underlying genetic studies were controlled for population stratification when necessary. Third, genetic predictors of exposure should not be independently associated with diabetes (IV3), and only mediate their effects via the relevant exposure. In other words, there is little evidence of pleiotropy. Sensitivity analyses with different assumptions about pleiotropy gave estimates with the IVW (Fig. 5). Since this study only used aggregate summary statistics, we were not able to assess differences by age, gender, or other factors. However, causal effects are generally expected to act consistently.

Association of genetically predicted mTOR-downstream targets exposures with diabetes outcome SNPS. Association between genetically determined EIF-4E, EIF-4A, EIF-4G, EIF4EBP2, and RP-S6K, mTOR downstream targets with Diabetes health outcome. The data source for exposure is the human plasma proteomics–GWAS INTERVAL study (n = 3,301) participants from publically available aggregate summary data47. The source for diabetes health outcome is DIAGRAM database (DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Metaanalysis case (n = 26,676), and control (n = 132,532); https ://www.diagr am-conso rtium .org/. For sensitivity analysis, we used uncorrelated SNPs for EIF-4E, IF-4A, EIF-4G, EIF4EBP2, and RP-S6K. Mendelian Randomization (MR-Base) R package was used in the analysis. In contrast to RCTs, MR studies inform the role of a specific causal pathway but do not reveal whether an intervention will be efficient. Furthermore, RCTs only report the effects of short-time exposures, while MR studies usually identify the lifetime exposures. The limitations of the MR study are those cohort populations recruited for the exposure (INTERVAL Study), and outcomes (DIAGRAM Study) were from European descent, which may limit the generalizability of the results to other populations. Cell culture and animal studies have documented an integral role of mTORC1 in glucose metabolism and diabetes24,25,67–70. Blandino-Rosano and colleagues have shown in Raptor, a mTORC1 specific partner, in a condi- tional knockout mouse model led to pancreatic β-cell failure due to defects in insulin secretion and cell prolifera- tion, and thus furthered the development of diabetes44–46,71,72. Ardestani and colleagues reported that mTORC1 positively regulates beta-cell growth and proliferation, thus promoting insulin secretion, while the hyperactiva- tion of mTORC1 led to beta-cell failure in type 2 diabetes16. Similarly, Tuo and Xiang reported a paradoxical role of mTORC1 on insulin secretion and β-cell metabolism31. The biphasic response of pancreatic β cells to mTORC1 activation has also been reported in mice43. Shigeyama and colleagues found that ablated Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 (TSC2), an upstream inhibitor of mTORC1m in mice (βTSC−/− mice), led to an initial increase in β cell mass and size in an mTOR-dependent manner. Furthermore, the mice were hyperinsulinemic and hypoglycemic. However, after 40 weeks of age, these mice became hypoinsulinemic and hyperglycemic due to a reduction in β cell mass and number43. Taken together, these two observations suggest that mTOR-mediated a biphasic response on insulin secretion.

Blandino-Rosano and colleagues found that the deletion of EIF-4EBP2 induced feedback and elevated glucose tolerance by increasing pancreatic beta-cell mass in knockout mice74. It is possible that EIF-4E and EIF-4A may regulate the mRNA translation of insulin protein, insulin receptor, or the enzymes involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism such as those regulating glycolysis and TCA cycle. We leveraged the use of the PhenoScanner curated database to explore possible causal mechanistic associations between the circulating levels of EIF-4E and EIF-4A and type 2 diabetes mellitus. We found 3 EIF-4E proxy SNPs namely, rs11084300, rs3848582, rs62143198, and 4 EIF-4A predicting SNPs, namely, rs3859507, rs11084300, rs34436714, rs146117463, that are associated with the NLRP12 gene. The NLPR12 is an inhibitory innate immune sensor and a marker of monocytes and macrophage inflammasomes. Recently, NLPR12 has been implicated in protecting against obesity by regulating the gut microbiota homeostasis, insulin-tolerance, and inflammation in mice75. Thus, we propose that EIF-4E and Scientific RepoRtS | (2020) 10:15737 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71987-8 8 Figure 4. (A) SNP variants associated with EIF-4E and the risk of type 2 diabetes.

Mendelian Randomization (MR-Base) R package was used in the analysis58. EIF-4A translation initiation proteins may have a protective effect on type 2 diabetes that is possibly mediated via NLPR12 inflammasome, which regulates the gut microbiome. Experimental laboratory data is warranted to explore the mechanistic pathway for this effect. Scientific RepoRtS | (2020) 10:15737 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71987-8 9 Figure 5. Comparisons of the Odds Ratio values and the 95% Upper Confidence Level and Lower Confidence Level between different MR Models. Comparison of the overall estimates of odds ratio values obtained by different MR models, including Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW), Weighted Median (WM), and MR PRESSO analyses of genetically determined EIF-4E, EIF-4A, EIF4G, EIF4EBP, and RP-S6K. Mendelian Randomization (MR-Base) R package and MR Base web applications were used in the analysis58. conclusion This unbiased MR study is consistent with a causal protective association of EIF-4E and EIF-4A with type 2 diabetes. EIF-4E and EIF-4A circulating levels, critical regulators of gene translation and protein functions, may be targets for intervention by repurposing existing therapeutics to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.

However, the function of mTORC1 downstream proteins, such as RPS6K, EIF4EBP, EIF-4E, EIF-4G, and EIF4A, in PD development remains unclear. Methods: We performed a Mendelian randomization study to evaluate the causal relationship between mTORC1 downstream proteins and Parkinson’s disease. We utilized various MR methods, including inverse-variance- weighted, weighted median, MR–Egger, MR-PRESSO, and MR-RAPS, and conducted sensitivity analyses to identify potential pleiotropy and heterogeneity. Results: The genetic proxy EIF4EBP was found to be inversely related to PD risk (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.67–0.92, p = 0.003), with the results from WM, MR-PRESSO, and MR-RAPS being consistent. The plasma protein levels of EIF4G were also observed to show a suggestive protective effect on PD (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.75–0.97, p = 0.014). No clear causal effect was found for the genetically predicted RP-S6K, EIF-4E, and EIF-4A on PD risk. Sensitivity analyses showed no signiﬁcant imbalanced pleiotropy or heterogeneity, indicating that the MR estimates were robust and independent. Conclusion: Our unbiased MR study highlights the protective role of serum EIF4EBP levels in PD, suggesting that the pharmacological activation of EIF4EBP activity could be a promising treatment option for PD.

Introduction The prevalence of Parkinson’s disease (PD), an age-related neurodegenerative con- dition, is increasing at a staggering rate [1]. In addition to decreased dopamine levels, it is typiﬁed by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which leads to symptoms such as tremors, muscle stiffness, and bradykinesia. The accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn), the major component of Lewy inclusion, has also emerged as a prominent neuropathological presentation of PD [2,3]. Unfortunately, there is currently no cure for PD. The current treatment strategies focus on managing symptoms and preventing neuronal death, making the identiﬁcation of new therapeutic targets for PD an urgent priority. Understanding the exact causes and mechanisms of the disease will aid in this effort. There is growing evidence that mTOR plays a key role in modulating the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of neurons [4]. The mTOR protein kinase is widely present in all types of mammalian cells and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including protein synthesis, establishment of the cytoskeleton structure, metabolic regulation, cell growth,","chunk_id":"Tan et al. - 2023 - mTORC1-Dependent Protein and Parkinson's Disease A Mendelian Randomization Study_0","doi":"Tan et al. - 2023 - mTORC1-Dependent Protein and Parkinson's Disease A Mendelian Randomization Study"},{"text":"and mechanisms of the disease will aid in this effort. There is growing evidence that mTOR plays a key role in modulating the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of neurons [4]. The mTOR protein kinase is widely present in all types of mammalian cells and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including protein synthesis, establishment of the cytoskeleton structure, metabolic regulation, cell growth, and survival [5,6]. mTOR exists in two distinct complexes: mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). mTORC1 is more responsive to rapamycin, the primary inhibitor of mTOR, than mTORC2 [7]. Various stimuli, such as alterations in the levels of insulin, energy, and amino acids, are perceived by mTORC1, which is frequently involved in protein synthesis, cell growth, cell proliferation, and autophagy. mTORC2, on the other hand, plays a role in cytoskeletal rearrangements [8,9]. Major targets Brain Sci. 2023, 13, 536. https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci13040536 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/brainsci Brain Sci. 2023, 13, 536 2 of 11 of mTORC1 include ribosomal protein S6K kinase 1 (RPS6K) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding proteins (EIF4EBPs). Both of them are the main regulators of cap-dependent protein synthesis and exert their effects on the regulation of protein translation by modulat- ing transcript initiation and elongation as well as ribosome biosynthesis [5,10]. Meanwhile, the eIF4F complex (eIF4E, eIF4G, and eIF4A) is essential for cap-dependent protein trans- lation, which is a rate-limiting step in protein synthesis. RPS6K is a positive regulator of eIF4F, while EIF4EBP tightly binds to eIF4E and negatively modulates eIF4F complex activity. Once EIF4EBP is phosphorylated by mTORC1, the dissociation of eIF4E–EIF4EBP initiates 5(cid:48) cap-dependent mRNA translation [11–13]. mTOR is thought to be involved in neurodegenerative disorders through its effects on autophagy and protein synthesis. In such disorders, an abnormal mTOR signaling cascade can disrupt autophagy ﬂux, leading to the accumulation of protein aggregates and hampering neuron survival [14]. As a critical regulator involved in cell metabolism and survival, mTOR has been considered a promising target against Parkinson’s disease. However, the role of mTOR in PD seems to be controversial, as both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects have been observed in different PD models. The neuroprotective effects induced by mTOR activation seem to contradict the beneﬁts of inhibiting mTOR in PD [15]. Therefore, we urgently want to know whether there is a causal relationship between mTORC1 downstream proteins and Parkinson’s disease, and whether this causality is protective or pathogenic. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis is a novel epidemiological method that uses summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to infer causality between exposures and certain diseases and identify potential risk factors. By using genetic variants as instrumental variables for exposures, MR can overcome the confounding factors that are often present in observational studies [16,17]. In this study, we used two-sample MR based on GWAS summary statistics of mTORC1-associated proteins in the European population to investigate the causal association of mTORC1-associated proteins (RPS6K, EIF4EBP, EIF-4E, EIF-4G, and EIF4A) with PD. 2.

Materials and Methods 2.1. Data Sources for Exposure The genetic variation of mTORC1-related proteins was extracted from the publicly available Human Plasma Proteome Atlas. The atlas includes data on 3622 plasma proteins obtained from 3301 healthy participants undergoing genetic control from the INTERVAL study [18]. These data link genetic factors to phenotypes based on protein information, providing a basis for potential targets for certain diseases. The INTERVAL study enrolled approximately 50,000 participants who were 18 years and older and excluded those with major diseases. The recruitment took place at 25 centers of England’s National Health Service Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) from mid-2012 to mid-2014. Blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes after standard venipuncture, and the isolated plasma was stored at −80 ◦C for research use [19]. The relative concentrations of 3622 plasma proteins were measured using the SOMAscan assay method, which can simultaneously measure extracellular and intracellular proteins as well as expand the lower limit of detection for protein abundance [20]. After a natural log transformation and adjustment for age, sex, and duration between the blood draw and linear regression processing, the protein concentrations could be determined [18]. 2.2. Data Sources for the Outcome The summary statistics for genetic studies on PD were gathered by the International Parkinson’s Disease Genomics Consortium. The data include 33,674 individuals diagnosed with PD and 449,056 controls from European ancestry samples. The analysis was a ﬁxed- effects meta-analysis across 17 datasets that all underwent a similar process of quality control for inclusion [21]. Brain Sci. 2023, 13, 536 3 of 11 2.3. Instrumental Variable We established inclusion criteria for selecting instrumental variables in order to obtain a precise assessment. These criteria include a signiﬁcance threshold of p < 5 × 10−6 and a linkage disequilibrium (LD) r2 < 0.05. Additionally, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with palindromic sequences were removed from the analysis. The acquired instru- mental variables were evaluated to ensure that they met the fundamental assumptions of a Mendelian randomization analysis (Figure 1): (1) they had to be signiﬁcantly associ- ated with the exposure of interest; (2) they must not have any relationship with potential confounders, and (3) the association between the instrumental variables and PD must be mediated by the exposure. We also utilized PhenoScanner to verify if any potential confounders were linked to the chosen instrumental variables by the SNPs. Ultimately, we identiﬁed reliable instrumental variables as proxies for the following proteins: RPS6K (16 SNPs), EIF4EBP (6 SNPs), EIF4E (13 SNPs), EIF4A (10 SNPs), and EIF4G (7 SNPs). Figure 1.

Mendelian Randomization Analyses We applied several MR methods including inverse-variance-weighted (IVW), weighted median (WM), and MR–Egger to determine the causal effects between mTORC1-related proteins and PD. The IVW results were used as primary information, and a meta-analysis was performed to aggregate the Wald estimates of single SNPs in order to obtain overall estimates of mTORC1-related proteins on PD, respectively. These unbiased results were based on the assumption that there was no horizontal pleiotropy [22]. MR–Egger [23] and weighted median [24] analyses were used as supplemental evidence for the IVW results as they provide more robust estimates under a broad range of scenarios, despite lower efﬁciency. The MR-RAPS method can weigh the instrumental variables based on their Brain Sci. 2023, 13, 536 4 of 11 strength, which improves the efﬁciency of MR estimates in the presence of weak instrumen- tal variables while also balancing pleiotropy [25]. Additionally, sensitivity analyses were conducted to detect potential pleiotropy and heterogeneity. Heterogeneity was reported via Cochran’s Q test (p < 0.05). The intercept of MR–Egger regression provided evidence to evaluate horizontal pleiotropy (p < 0.05) [26]. MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) identiﬁed biased variants if they existed and removed them progressively to reduce any sign of horizontal pleiotropy [27]. Finally, the leave-one-out method was used to test whether any individual SNP confounded the effect estimates, for more robust conclusions. All the statistical analyses were carried out using the TwoSampleMR (version 0.5.6) and MR-PRESSO (version 1.0) packages in R (version 4.2.1). The p-value threshold for Bonferroni correction was set at 0.01 (0.05/5) to adjust for multiple testing. Results with a signiﬁcance level of less than 0.01 were considered strong evidence of a causal relationship, while those with a signiﬁcance level between 0.01 and 0.05 were considered indicative evidence of a relationship. 3. Results As seen in Figure 2, the levels of the genetic proxy EIF4EBP were found to have an inverse association with the risk of PD (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.67–0.92, p = 0.003). The results obtained from WM, MR-PRESSO, and MR-RAPS were consistent, which added conﬁdence to the conclusion that this association is likely causal. Additionally, indicative evidence was found for a potential causal effect of EIF4G levels on the risk of PD, whereby higher levels reduced the risk (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.75–0.97, p = 0.014). Similar causal estimates were also obtained using MR-PRESSO (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.82–0.89, p = 0.012) and MR-RAPS (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.80–0.91, p = 0.012). The detailed instrumental variables in the analysis were listed (Table S1). The impact of individual variables of EIF4EBP and EIF4G on PD was further demonstrated through the scatterplot and forest plot presented in Figure 3. However, the analysis of the effects of RPS6K, EIF4A, and EIF4E levels on the risk of PD did not reach statistical signiﬁcance.

Further- more, the MR–Egger regression intercept showed no evidence of unbalanced pleiotropy (all p > 0.05) (Table 1). The global test of MR-PRESSO also did not identify any pleiotropic bias. In addition, the absence of any signiﬁcant SNPs in the leave-one-out sensitivity analysis (Figure 4) suggests that no individual SNP could disrupt the causal relationship. Table 1.

Discussion As far as we know, this study is the initial investigation into the causal connection between the levels of mTORC1-dependent proteins (including RPS6K, EIF4EBP, EIF-4E, EIF-4A, and EIF-4G) and PD using MR methods and eliminating potential confounding factors through genetic variations. Utilizing data from the INTERVAL study on human plasma protein arrays and GWAS summary statistics from the International Parkinson’s Disease Genomics Consortium (IPDGC), we conducted a two-sample MR analysis. The MR study indicated a negative correlation between the levels of the EIF4EBP protein in the plasma (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.67–0.92, p = 0.003) and PD risk. We also discovered suggestive evidence of a protective effect of the plasma protein levels of EIF4G on PD (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.75–0.97, p = 0.014), despite the p-value not being signiﬁcant after Bonferroni correction.

However, no clear evidence was found to support a causal effect of the gene-predicted RP-S6K, EIF-4E, and EIF-4A on PD risk. Sensitivity analyses also did not reveal any signiﬁcant imbalanced pleiotropy or heterogeneity, indicating that the MR estimates were independent and robust. The mechanism by which mTOR regulates the survival of dopamine-producing neu- rons is still largely unknown. The inhibition of mTORC1 with rapamycin has been shown to decrease the levels of PARK7/DJ1, a protein linked to neurodegeneration that has beneﬁ- cial molecular chaperone and antioxidant properties and whose translation depends on mTORC1. Loss-of-function mutations in PARK7 are associated with early-onset, recessive forms of Parkinson’s disease [28]. The mTOR signaling pathway is essential for regulating protein synthesis and cell survival; thus, it is important to keep it active for its protective role in neurons. However, the ﬁne-tuning of mTOR activation may be necessary during Parkinson’s disease. mTORC1 controls both protein synthesis through translation and pro- tein degradation through autophagy. It negatively regulates autophagy by phosphorylating Atg13 and ULK1/2, inhibiting the formation of autophagosomes [29,30]. Alpha-synuclein accumulation is a hallmark of Parkinson’s disease, and it is believed to play a key role in the death of dopamine-producing neurons. By inhibiting mTOR, rapamycin promotes autophagy, which is a process by which cells degrade and recycle waste proteins and damaged cellular components. By increasing autophagy, rapamycin may help to prevent the accumulation of toxic alphasynuclein and protect dopamine-producing neurons from death. This highlights the potential therapeutic value of mTOR inhibition for treating Parkinson’s disease [31]. In summary, excessive or inadequate mTOR activity can be lethal to neurons. EIF4EBP is a crucial component of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, and its activity is tightly regulated by the balance of its phosphorylation levels. When EIF4EBP is un- derphosphorylated, it binds strongly to eIF4E, thus inhibiting cap-dependent translation initiation. However, when excessive phosphorylation occurs, EIF4EBP is released from eIF4E, resulting in increased cap-dependent translation [32,33]. The postmortem analysis of the brains of PD patients suggests oxidative stress as a potential mechanism of neu- rodegeneration. This is indicated by a lack of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) and the inhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity in the substantia nigra, along with increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity [34]. It has been proven that EIF4EBP is crucial for survival during stressful conditions, including starvation and oxidative stress. Activated EIF4EBP induces a rapid halt in cap-dependent translation, promoting the upregulation of stress response factors, such as antioxidants and molecular chaperones [35–37]. CHCHD2 is a mitochondrial protein-encoding gene that controls oxidative phosphorylation by regu- lating Cyt c and crista integrity. Dominant mutations in this gene are the cause of late-onset PD [38].

CHCHD2 is a mitochondrial protein-encoding gene that controls oxidative phosphorylation by regu- lating Cyt c and crista integrity. Dominant mutations in this gene are the cause of late-onset PD [38]. In a limited case study, several exonic variants that may affect CHCHD2 protein levels or subcellular localization showed an association with Parkinson’s disease [39]. In Drosophila, the loss of CHCHD2 can lead to abnormalities in the mitochondrial matrix structure and impaired mitochondrial respiration, which exacerbates the sensitivity to oxidative stress, loss of dopaminergic neurons, and motor dysfunction associated with Parkinson’s disease. In addition to these PD pathological phenotypes, a compensatory Brain Sci. 2023, 13, 536 8 of 11 upregulation of 4E-BP was also observed. These PD-related phenotypes were alleviated by the overexpression of the translation inhibitor 4E-BP and the introduction of human CHCHD2. By introducing 4E-BP into dCHCHD2-/-Drosophila, the general expression of 4E-BP decreased the ATP decline in drosophila. The same outcome was achieved by admin- istering rapamycin, which activates 4E-BP by inhibiting the kinase target of rapamycin [40]. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a prominent feature of PD, and the beneﬁcial role of 4E-BP in mitochondria reverses PD pathological phenotypes. Additionally, mutations in PINK1 and parkin lead to autosomal recessive hereditary Parkinson’s disease. Drosophila with PINK1 and parkin mutations display dopaminergic neurodegeneration, motor defects, and mito- chondrial dysfunction. These mutations are associated with signiﬁcant reductions in the phosphorylated levels of EIF4EBP, with corresponding increases in the proportion of active nonphosphorylated EIF4EBP. The over-expression of EIF4EBP can suppress all pathological phenotypes, and the loss of EIF4EBP function signiﬁcantly reduces the survival ability of parkin and PINK1 mutants. In vivo, EIF4EBP can be activated by the TOR inhibitor rapamycin [41]. Moreover, LRRK2 homologous mutations in Drosophila can produce PD phenotypes similar to those caused by parkin/PINK1 mutations, the most common genetic cause of PD [42]. LRRK2 contains both an active GTPase and kinase domain, which can promote cap-dependent translation and exhibit strong genetic interactions with the core members and regulators of the cap-binding protein complex. Generally, disease-associated mutations in LRRK2 often increase its kinase activity, thereby enhancing its toxicity. To date, a large number of LRRK2 mutations have been identiﬁed, with the G2019S variant being the most common. This mutation leads to increased protein synthesis in neurons, exhibiting the age-related loss of dopaminergic neurons and motor dysfunction, which can be improved by blocking the synthesis with protein synthesis inhibitors [43,44]. LRRK2 acts as a protein translation regulator by phosphorylating the 4E-BP protein at the T37/T46 site both in vitro and in vivo. However, the control of translation initiation is closely related to stress and lifespan, and these phosphorylation events appear to have important effects on stress sensitivity and dopaminergic neuron survival in LRRK2 mutant Drosophila. On the one hand, the overexpression of eIF4E and dLRRK leads to age-related phenotypes in DA neurons, whose gene expression pattern is consistent with gene expression under oxidative stress and aging conditions. This strongly suggests that a chronic decline in 4E-BP","chunk_id":"Tan et al. - 2023 - mTORC1-Dependent Protein and Parkinson's Disease A Mendelian Randomization Study_6","doi":"Tan et al. - 2023 - mTORC1-Dependent Protein and Parkinson's Disease A Mendelian Randomization Study"},{"text":"stress and lifespan, and these phosphorylation events appear to have important effects on stress sensitivity and dopaminergic neuron survival in LRRK2 mutant Drosophila. On the one hand, the overexpression of eIF4E and dLRRK leads to age-related phenotypes in DA neurons, whose gene expression pattern is consistent with gene expression under oxidative stress and aging conditions. This strongly suggests that a chronic decline in 4E-BP activity promotes oxidative stress and subsequent aging in DA neurons. On the other hand, it has been observed that the overexpression of 4E-BP or a reduction in dLRRK levels can provide protection in Drosophila models of PINK1 and parkin pathology [41,44,45]. This suggests that regulating 4E-BP expression to suppress the accumulation of abnormal protein is beneﬁcial. In our study, we revealed an inverse association between the levels of the genetic proxy EIF4EBP and PD risk. This is consistent with the observed effects in experimental studies. The expression of speciﬁc target genes and protein levels in circulation can be mod- ulated, making them potential targets for preventing PD. Given the mounting evidence implicating the mTOR signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of PD, it is unclear whether there is a causal relationship between mTORC1-related proteins and PD. Using epidemio- logical research methods, we determined in this study that an increase in EIF4EBP protein levels can help prevent PD, as previously observed in experimental studies. The disclo- sure of this unbiased causal relationship will guide a direction for future PD prevention and provide a potential intervention target, while also requiring further basic research to uncover potential pathophysiological mechanisms. In conclusion, targeting the mTOR pathway pharmacologically has promising potential as a treatment for PD. Further work is needed to fully understand the nuanced regulation of mTOR and its complex cellular pathways. It is crucial to continue the development of mTOR signaling modulators that meet therapeutic goals, while mitigating the adverse effects of current mTOR regulators, to achieve the desired clinical outcomes without negative consequences. The pharmacologic activation of EIF4EBP activity may represent a viable treatment option for PD. Brain Sci. 2023, 13, 536 9 of 11 One advantage of this study is the use of MR design. As alleles are randomly assigned and ﬁxed at conception, it minimizes the potential for observed associations to be biased by reverse causation and confounding. Secondly, we employed various MR methods including IVW, MR–Egger, WM, and MR-RAPS to robustly estimate causal relationships. MR–Egger regression and MR-PRESSO were used to detect pleiotropy to ensure the robustness of the conclusions. Thirdly, we provided robust genetic instruments by using multiple SNPs as instrumental variables for mTORC1-related proteins. Fourthly, our analysis utilized a large sample size with no overlap between the exposure and outcome, thereby result- ing in high statistical power for most of the analyses. This study has several limitations. Firstly, all the GWAS data were from individuals of European ancestry, and it remains to be determined whether the results observed in this study are generalizable to other populations.

Therefore, future studies utilizing MR to investigate the causal relationship between mTORC1-dependent proteins (including RPS6K, EIF4EBP, EIF-4E, EIF-4A, and EIF-4G) and PD should consider including samples from different ethnic groups to increase the generalizability of the ﬁndings. Secondly, as the study used summary statistics data and not individual-level data, it was not possible to conduct a subgroup analysis. Thirdly, the genetic variants used in MR studies reﬂect lifetime exposure and speciﬁc causal associa- tions, whereas randomized controlled trials only report the effects of short-term exposure. Therefore, it is difﬁcult to determine the effects of short-term exposure to high levels of EIF4EBP proteins on PD risk and to understand the effectiveness of any interventions. 5. Conclusions This unbiased MR study highlights the protective role of serum EIF4EBP levels in PD. Further research is required regarding the study of EIF4EBP’s role. Nevertheless, this study’s ﬁndings lay the foundation for a more effective pharmacological target in preventing and treating PD.

Applying systems biology to identify new applications for current pharmaceuticals can decrease the duration, expenses, and likelihood of failure associated with the development of new drugs. Methods: We identify tendinopathy signature genes employing a transcriptomics database encompassing 154 clinical tendon samples. We then proposed a systems biology based drug prediction strategy that encompassed multiplex transcriptional drug prediction, systematic review assessment, deep learning based efficacy prediction and Mendelian randomization (MR). Finally, we evaluated the effects of drug target using gene knockout mice. Results: We demonstrate that sirolimus is a repurposable drug for tendinopathy, supported by: 1) Sirolimus achieves top ranking in drug-gene signature-based multiplex transcriptional drug efficacy prediction, 2) Consistent evidence from systematic review substantiates the efficacy of sirolimus in the management of ten- dinopathy, 3) Genetic prediction indicates that plasma proteins inhibited by mTOR (the target of sirolimus) are associated with increased tendinopathy risk. The effectiveness of sirolimus is further corroborated through in vivo testing utilizing tendon tissue–specific mTOR gene knockout mice. Integrative pathway enrichment analysis suggests that mTOR inhibition can regulate heterotopic ossification-related pathways to ameliorate clinical tendinopathy. Conclusions: Our study assimilates knowledge of system-level responses to identify potential drugs for tendin- opathy, and suggests sirolimus as a viable candidate. A systems biology approach could expedite the repurposing of drugs for human diseases that do not have well-defined targets. 1.

Computers in Biology and Medicine 186 (2025) 109665 frequently encounter the peril of postoperative non-healing and re-tearing [4]. Over the years, corticosteroid injections have been the mainstay pharmacological treatment for tendinopathy. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of corticosteroid injections remains controversial [5]. In conclusion, there is an urgent need for effective pharmacological treatment for tendinopathy. The process of drug discovery is typically inefficient, marked by escalating expenses, lengthy duration, and a high percentage of wastage [6]. Drug repurposing is a strategy that involves using existing phar- maceuticals that have already been thoroughly investigated for their safety and pharmacokinetic characteristics to treat different medical conditions [7]. Sildenafil, initially an antihypertensive, was repurposed by Pfizer for erectile dysfunction. By 2012, it held a 47 % market share, with global sales of $2.05 billion [8]. The typical cost of introducing a repurposed medicine to the market is projected to be around US$300 million, while a novel chemical entity is anticipated to cost between US $2–3 billion [7]. However, even in the case of medications that already exist, the procedure of conducting experimental preclinical screening followed by human safety and efficacy studies is arduous and time-consuming. Hence, it is imperative to prioritize the candidate medications. Over the past few decades, there has been substantial advancement and extensive adoption of high-throughput technologies, leading to a dramatic surge in the volume of omics data. There is a wealth of publicly available research that extensively examines the relationship between genetic variation and the effectiveness of treatment. The intricacy of disease biology and the necessity for customized treatment can be addressed by a systematic approach that relies on high-throughput data to confront significant obstacles in drug repurposing. In this regard, the application of systems biology might accelerate the process of priori- tizing candidate drugs by utilizing various strategies to thoroughly examine and integrate the existing information on a specific drug [8]. The goal of systems biology is to understand physiology and disease from the levels of molecular pathways, regulatory networks, cells, tis- sues, organs, and ultimately the entire organism [9].","chunk_id":"Wang et al. - 2025 - Sirolimus as a repurposed drug for tendinopathy A systems biology approach combining computational_1","doi":"Wang et al. - 2025 - Sirolimus as a repurposed drug for tendinopathy A systems biology approach combining computational"},{"text":"repurposing. In this regard, the application of systems biology might accelerate the process of priori- tizing candidate drugs by utilizing various strategies to thoroughly examine and integrate the existing information on a specific drug [8]. The goal of systems biology is to understand physiology and disease from the levels of molecular pathways, regulatory networks, cells, tis- sues, organs, and ultimately the entire organism [9]. Drug repositioning based on systems biology can be defined as: in drug repositioning under specific drug conditions, the use of high-throughput genomic data from humans and various model organisms. These different types of data are integrated using systems biology approaches, including network-based and signature-based methods; the predicted outputs are validated in different model organisms [10]. This work presents a systems biology approach to identify prospec- tive treatment candidates for tendinopathy by 1) applying multiplex transcriptional drug prediction based on a clinical tendon tran- scriptomics database, 2) screening candidates through systematic re- view and evidence level assessment, 3) evaluating high-potential drugs through deep learning integrating drug structure information, and 4) exploring genetic evidence of drugs for tendinopathy treatment in Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. Finally, we validated thera- peutic potential of the sirolimus target against clinical tendinopathy based on animal models. 2. Methods 2.1. Key resources table used in the study.

The patient’s consent and clearance from the local ethics committee were acquired (Ethics Committee of the second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, code: 2019-168, 2020-080). 2.2.2. Experimental model The Zhejiang University Experimental Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee approved animal studies in accordance with the guidelines of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (ZJU20220006). In the in vivo drug experiment, 12 8-week-old rats (equal numbers of males and females) were induced with tendinopathy by injecting 30U Type I collagenase (Gibco, 17100017) into the midportion of the Achilles tendon of 8-week-old rats. The same procedure was repeated after 3 days to stabilize the effect. Divide the 12 rats into two groups, with each rat receiving four subcutaneous injections (between the Achilles tendon and the skin, every 3 days) one week after modeling: the control group (sterile PBS, 20 μL) and the sirolimus group (sirolimus, 70uM, 20 μL). Weekly assessments of motor function were conducted on the rats after modeling, followed by euthanasia for transcriptomic sequencing and histological evaluation. The effectiveness of sirolimus is further corroborated through in vivo testing utilizing tendon tissue–specific mTOR gene knockout mice. The tendinopathy was generated by injecting 12.5 U of type 1 collagenase (Gibco, 17100017) into the middle of the right Achilles tendons of 8- week-old mice. The same operation was performed 3 days later to sta- bilize the effect. At 6 weeks following modeling, 8 wild-type (WT) mice and 8 mTOR tendon knockout (mTOR-TKO) mice were euthanized. The legs were then excised for histopathology. 2.3. Method details 2.3.1. RNA sequence The tissue was subjected to RNA extraction using TRIzol® Reagent following the directions provided by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Subsequently, DNase I (TaKara) was used to eliminate genomic DNA. The RNA-seq transcriptome libraries were generated using the Tru- SeqTM RNA sample preparation Kit from Illumina (San Diego, CA). A total of 1 μg of RNA was used for this process. In brief, messenger RNA was extracted using polyA selection through oligo(dT) beads and sub- sequently fragmented using a fragmentation buffer. The process involved in this study included cDNA synthesis, end repair, A-base addition, and ligation of the Illumina-indexed adaptors, following the methodology provided by Illumina.

These selected li- braries were then subjected to PCR amplification using Phusion DNA polymerase (NEB) for a total of 15 PCR cycles. Following quantification using the TBS380, the paired-end libraries were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq with a run length of 2X150bp. 2.3.2. Reads quality control and mapping The unprocessed paired end readings underwent trimming and quality checking using Trimmomatic with the default parameters (htt p://www.usadellab.org/cms/uploads/supplementary/Trimmomatic). The clean reads were aligned to the reference genome using the hisat2 software in orientation mode [23]. Tophat is a software application designed to match RNA-Seq reads to a genome. Its purpose is to discover gene expression and exon-exon splice junctions. It is constructed using the high-speed short read mapping software Bowtie2. This software was utilized to create a map using the default settings. value with a threshold of 0.05, the differential genes were sorted by Log2(Foldchange) value. Ultimately, we identified the top 150 genes that were up-regulated and the top 150 genes that were down-regulated as the definitive genes associated with tendinopathy. 2.3.4. Multi-pipeline transcriptomic drug prediction and reranking Tendinopathy signature genes were used as an input in three com- plementary signature-based medication repurposing tools: Connectivity Map, DREIMT and SPIED [13–15]. We obtained four candidate drug lists, with Connectivity Map and DREIMT providing one each, and SPIED’s two databases providing one each. In Connectivity Map, drugs were ranked according to connectivity scores. In DREIMT, 100 drugs are initially screened based on Drug specificity score (DSS) and then drugs are ranked by prioritization score (tau). In SPIED, drugs with negative correlation were selected and ranked according to significance. Every drug list consists of 80 drugs with the highest potential in certain method for reversing tendinopathy at the molecular level (Supplementary Table 1). The Computational Drug Repositioning Score (CoDReS) tool was employed to reevaluate the potential drugs by considering (a) a func- tional score that combines the relevance of drug targets to the disease and the strength of their binding to target genes, (b) an a-priori score that is determined by the initial ranking of drugs in each list, and (c) a structural score that indicates violations in drugability [16]. We con- ducted CoDReS reranking on the top 80 medications from 4 lists. The normalized a-priori repurposing score was calculated by dividing the original ranking score of each drug from the 4 lists by the absolute maximum ranking score. The top 30 drugs based on CoDReS aggregate score were selected for further analysis (Supplementary Table 2). 2.3.5.

The keywords and studies included in systematic review are listed in the Supplementary Table s 3 and 4. 2.3.6. Chemical structure diversity analysis and clustering We conducted a thorough search and obtained the molecular struc- tures of the potential pharmaceutical compounds from DrugBank [25]. Next, we obtained the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) format of the compounds from PubChem. This format was then utilized as input in the C-SPADE tool to calculate the distance matrix, which measures the chemical and structural similarities of the compounds [18,26]. The structural similarity was calculated based on Dice similarity coefficient. 2.3.7. Deep learning-based efficacy prediction system The Deep Learning based Efficacy Prediction System (DLEPS) employed a variational autoencoder to encode small molecules in SMILES format. It then utilized a dense network to predict changes in transcriptional profiles based on the latent vectors.

The two-sample 3 Z. Wang et al.

We have suggested a tool that involves the selection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 100 kb windows from the target gene HMGCR. These SNPs are associated with low-density lipo- protein (LDL) cholesterol levels at a genome-wide significance level (P- value <1 × 10(cid:0) 6). The purpose of this tool is to serve as a proxy for the exposure to statins. In order to optimize the effectiveness of the instru- ment, SNPs employed as instruments were permitted to have a low level of weak linkage disequilibrium (r2 < 0.30) with one another. A GWAS summary data of LDL cholesterol levels obtained from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (GLGC) was utilized to identify SNPs [28]. The data on exposure to mTOR-related genes were collected from the proteomics-GWAS data, which is publicly accessible, in a total of 3301 people from the INTERVAL research [29]. SNPs reaching genome-wide (cid:0) 6) and linkage disequilibrium-pruned (r2 significance (P-value <1 × 10 < 0.05) were included. 2.3.9. Treadmill assessment Following two consecutive days of acclimatization (15 m/min, 30 ◦ ), the rats’ running performance was tested by measuring min/day, 0 their ability to run until exhaustion. In the functional evaluation, the rats ran on a treadmill (SANS, SA101) at an initial speed of 2 m/min, fol- lowed by incremental speeds of 2 m/min2 until they reached a pre- defined exhaustion point (defined as when the animal’s hind limbs remained on the grid for over 10 s, indicating exhaustion). 2.3.10. Histological evaluation Tissue specimens were harvested and fixed in 4 % (v/v) PFA for 24 h at room temperature. After dehydration with gradient alcohol, the samples were embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 6 μm, and per- formed hematoxylin & eosin (HE) and Masson staining. Adapted from a modified version of the Movin grading system [30], the histological evaluation was scored by a blinded scorer using a semi-quantitative scoring system based on H&E staining results. 2.3.11. Protein-protein interaction network construction and visualization Using the STRING database (v.12.0), we constructed a protein- protein interaction network with a medium confidence score of 0.4 using differentially expressed genes as input. We downloaded a tab- separated value format file and imported it into Cytoscape (v.3.9.1) for subsequent interactive analysis. The largest clusters were selected based on the number of nodes to build the visual network. Functional enrichments of the network were performed using gene ontology and TISSUES.

ActivePathways R package [21]. ActivePathways utilized the Brown’s version of the Fisher’s combined probability test to generate an inte- grated gene list.

An integrated gene was sub- jected to a pathway enrichment study utilizing a ranked hypergeometric test and a collection of gene sets (c5.all.v7.5.1.symbols from Human Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)) [32]. Subsequently, the family-wise multiple testing correction method was employed to iden- tify the pathways that were significantly enriched in the integrated gene list (Qpathway <0.05). Fold-change in gene expression was used as directional assumptions for prioritizing negatively-associated pairs of tendinopathy/mTOR-inhibition pairs. Significantly enriched pathways (p < 0.05) were visualized using Cytoscape with standard protocols [33]. 2.3.13. Transcriptional overlap analysis We employed rank-rank hypergeometric overlap (RRHO) analysis to determine transcriptional overlap between tendinopathy patients and the collagenase model [20]. The gene lists were ordered and signed based on their level of differential expression in tendinopathy patients and the collagenase model compared to healthy controls, respectively (measured as Log2(Foldchange)). A hypergeometric P-value matrix was generated using repeated statistical tests to assess the proportion of ranking genes that vary between different conditions. The Benjamini and Yekutieli approach was used to accomplish multiple testing correction [34]. The adjusted P-values were visualized using a heat map, where each pixel represents the adjusted –log10 hypergeometric P-values. These values indicate the level of transcriptional overlap be- tween tendinopathy patients and the collagenase model. 2.4. Quantification and statistical analysis 2.4.1. Statistical analysis The primary method of MR analysis employed was inverse variance weighted (IVW) analysis. The weighted median and MR Egger regres- sion methods were employed in additional analysis [35]. The Cocrane’s Q test was employed to ascertain the presence of heterogeneity among the SNPs [36]. A directional pleiotropy measure was calculated based on the intercept obtained from MR Egger regression [37]. A significance level of p < 0.05 was utilized to determine statistical significance. Additionally, MR-PRESSO was employed to identify outlier SNPs [38]. If the presence of horizontal pleiotropy is detected but no heterogeneity is seen, the MR Egger approach will be chosen. If heterogeneity was detected without evidence of pleiotropy, the weight median technique was chosen. A positive result can be considered if the IVW approach yields a significant result (p < 0.05), even if the findings of other methods are not significant, and there is no evidence of pleiotropy and heterogeneity. This is contingent upon the beta values of the other methods being in the same direction [39]. We conducted \"leave-one-out\" studies, where we systematically excluded one SNP at a time, in order to assess the robustness of our findings. The numerical data were displayed as the average value plus or minus the standard deviation. A Student’s t-test was conducted to determine if there were any significant statistical differences between the groups. Statistical significance was attributed to P values less than 0.05.

Integrative pathway enrichment analysis Integrative pathway enrichment analysis was instructed to excavate the potential of mTOR inhibition in clinical tendinopathy treatment. Analysis of differential genes from tendinopathy patients versus healthy controls and WT mice versus mTOR-TKO mice were conducted using the Having a sophisticated candidate drug ranking is essential in order to choose the most promising medications for testing. During the first part of the analysis, we collected 154 clinical tendon samples from patients to acquire highly informed tendinopathy transcriptional signatures. After filtering the p-values with a threshold of 0.05, differentially expressed 4 Z. Wang et al. Computers in Biology and Medicine 186 (2025) 109665 genes were ranked based on Log2(Foldchange) values. Ultimately, we identified the top 150 upregulated genes and the top 150 downregulated genes as the key genes associated with tendinopathy. Secondly, we applied three discrete prediction approaches based on (i) Connectivity Map, (ii) DREIMT and (iii) SPIED. These three drug repurposing tools are complementary in terms of prediction methods and databases. We aim to obtain reliable and comprehensive lists of candidate drugs through their synergistic application (Fig. 1). All medicines listed can be found in Supplementary Table 1. During the last part of the analysis, the Computational Drug Repo- sitioning Score (CoDReS) tool was used to rerank the candidate drugs from multiple lists [16]. In addition to incorporating drug prioritization information from drug repurposing tools, CoDReS also examined other types of drug information. We conducted CoDReS reranking on the top 80 medications based on their weighted normalized score from each of the four drug lists. Fig. 2 illustrates the performance of the top 30 drugs based on the CoDReS aggregate score across different drug prediction pipelines. Step 1: we identified a set of robust tendinopathy signature genes based on a transcriptomics database encompassing 154 clinical tendon samples. Step 2: we conducted multi-pipeline transcriptomic drug pre- diction in three complementary signature-based drug repurposing tools. The connectivity score in Connectivity Map is the proportion of refer- ence gene sets that have a higher resemblance to the perturbagen compared to the current query. The DREIMT Drug specificity score (DSS) summarizes the replicability of a given drug profile across mul- tiple cell lines. The prioritization score (tau) indicates the degree of specificity for a given drug profile-immune signature association pair compared to a large set of drug-immune signatures association pairs in DREIMT’s database. The tendinopathy signature genes in SPIED3 are rated based on their connection with the particular SPIED3 entry using a Z-score derived from a Pearson regression analysis. Step 3: we reranked drugs using CoDReS based on a combination of functional and structural criteria. 3.2.

Filtering drugs with systematic review and evidence level assessment We conducted a systematic review on the top 30 candidate drugs’ efficacy for tendinopathy (Fig. 3). Information on the related drug, title, publication year, research category, major findings and conclusion are extracted (Supplementary Table 4). Subsequently, we narrowed down the selection of prospective medications for tendinopathy treatment by considering their established evidence. This resulted in a total of 8 candidate drugs, as depicted in Fig. 4. Some preclinical evidence sug- gests the potential effectiveness of diethylstilbestrol, calpeptin, raloxi- fene, and progesterone. We will discuss the statins and sirolimus in greater detail below due to their abundant and high-level evidence. The effectiveness of statins is supported by the highest level of evi- dence. A systematic review included three cohort studies and one case- control study showed that simvastatin can reduce the risk of RCT [40]. A nationwide 11-year follow-up study showed that hyperlipidemia alone was an independent risk factor for RCT. Statins use might provide pro- tection against RCT in patients with hyperlipidemia [41]. However, some studies demonstrated that statins are not beneficial to tendinop- athy, and even lead to tendinopathy. A combined cohort and experi- mental investigation shown that the use of statins raises the clinical risk of tendinopathy by causing the release of matrix metalloproteinases [42]. A animal study evaluated the biomechanical and histopathological effects of statins on the Achilles tendon in rats [43]. The results showed that statins are associated with calcific tendinopathy risk. Overall, the effects of statins are controversial. Consistent evidence from 1 case series, 2 animal studies, and 1 in vitro test indicated the effectiveness of sirolimus. Clinical date indicated that sirolimus is efficient in systemic lupus erythematosus induced tendinopathy [44]. Preclinical studies have shown that sirolimus can alleviate tendon ossification and reverse tendon aging. In our previous study, we found that targeted pathological collagen delivery of sustained release sirolimus can prevent heterotopic tendon ossification [11]. Another study provided evidence that the intake of sirolimus through diet effectively decelerated or halted the natural progression of age-related tendon stiffness and the decline in energy storage capability [45]. Furthermore, a study shown that sirolimus has a partial inhibitory effect on senescence-associated β-gal activity and morphological changes. This suggests that sirolimus can reverse senescence in rat tendon stem/progenitor cells at both the molecular and cellular levels [46].

Deep learning-based drug efficacy prediction In this section, we conducted a re-evaluation of high-potential drugs by integrating drug structure information. Firstly, we constructed and visualized a network depicting structural similarities among drugs to assess structural diversity. We computed the structural distance matrix by utilizing the Dice similarity coefficient to compare all possible pairs of candidate medicines. The hierarchical clustering analysis demon- strated that the input medications exhibited a wide range of chemical structural diversity, as shown in Fig. 5A. Afterwards, we utilized DLEPS to evaluate the effectiveness of medicines. DLEPS is a neural network that use linear representation of chemical structures as input to accu- rately model transcriptional profiles obtained from the L1000 project. This enables researchers to make predictions on the relationship be- tween chemical structure and transcriptional features [17]. DLEPS analysis showed that all eight medications exhibited promising potential in alleviating tendinopathy (Fig. 5B). Statins and sirolimus, which are ranked high in multiplex transcriptional prediction and supported by abundant literature evidence, continue to perform well in DLEPS.

B, Enrichment scores of drug candidates from DLEPS based on tendinopathy gene signatures as the genetic input. Using MR to identify genetic evidence of drugs for tendinopathy treatment. We further explored genetic evidence of statins and sirolimus for tendinopathy treatment (Fig. 6). This study includes two pharmaco- logical targets as exposures: mTOR inhibitors and HMGCR inhibitors. We performed a MR analysis using the summary statistics from a Eu- ropean population-based GWAS dataset. The analysis focused on mTORC1-related proteins in plasma, specifically RP-S6K, EIF4EBP, and EIF-4F components. In addition, we suggested a method in which we chose certain SNPs within 100 kilobase windows from the HMGCR gene, which was linked to LDL cholesterol levels at a significant level across the entire genome. This method serves as a proxy for measuring the effects of statins. GWAS data of RCT was obtained by extracting sum- mary statistics from 299,273 individuals in the FinnGen consortium. This study utilises the connections of the chosen genetic tools to represent the pharmacological adjustment of the drug’s target protein of interest.

Following phosphorylation by mTORC1, PR-S6K triggers the activation of EIF-4B, which in turn exerts a positive regulatory effect on EIF-4F. EIF4E-BP functions as a suppressor of EIF-4E. When phosphorylated by mTORC1, it separates from EIF-4E and subsequently facilitates the formation of the EIF-4F complex. The EIF-4F complex consists of EIF-4E, EIF-4G, and EIF-4A. The outcome of MR is rotator cuff syndrome extracted from the FinnGen consortium. The primary MR analysis uti- lized inverse variance weighted analysis. The study employed weighted median and MR Egger regression methods in supplementary analysis. A proteome-wide MR approach is employed to ascertain the corre- lation between circulating protein levels reliant on mTORC1 and RCT. After removing SNPs that exhibited linkage disequilibrium, outline, or palindromic sequence, a total of 55 SNPs were selected for genetic prediction of mTORC1 downstream proteins (Supplementary Table 6). We evaluated the potency of SNPs employed as the instrument by uti- lizing the F-statistic. To mitigate any potential bias from weak in- struments, we only considered SNPs with an F-statistic greater than 10 [47]. The results indicate that there is evidence linking the higher expression of mTORC1 downstream proteins in blood with an increased risk of RCT in IVW (odds ratio (OR) = 1.03, 95 % confidence interval (cid:0) 3), Weighted median (OR = 1.04, (CI) = 1.01–1.08; P-value = 1.11 × 10 CI = 1.01–1.06; P-value = 0.01) and MR Egger (OR = 1.05, CI = (cid:0) 3), indicating that sirolimus might 1.01–1.08; P-value = 4.11 × 10 lower the risk of RCT (Fig. 7A–C). In addition, the analyses that excluded each SNP showed that no one SNP was responsible for these results. Instead, the results were indicative of a combined pattern (Fig. 7B). The funnel plot displayed no evidence of heterogeneity (Fig. 7D). Next, we examined the causality between HMGCR-mediated LDL cholesterol levels and RCT. From the GWAS summary data of LDL cholesterol levels, a total of 7 SNPs located within or near the HMGCR gene were chosen (Supplementary Table 6).

Validating the therapeutic potential of sirolimus target against clinical tendinopathy Thus far, sirolimus’s potential effectiveness for tendinopathy is supported by evidence from multiple levels. Sirolimus is a highly effective drug that suppresses the immune system. It works by attaching to FK-binding protein-12 and preventing the activation of the protein kinase called mammalian target of sirolimus mycin [48]. In 1999, the US Food and Drug Administration granted approval for sirolimus as a means to avoid the rejection of solid organ transplants. Since then, over the course of the previous two decades, sirolimus has been discovered to be a medicine that is well-tolerated by patients and had an outstanding safety record [48]. We studied the therapeutic efficacy of sirolimus in a tendinopathy model. Treadmill running experiments showed that the sirolimus 7 Z. Wang et al.

In the assessment after four doses, the functional improvement in the sirolimus treatment group compared to the PBS group was statistically significant (Fig. 8B). His- tology indicated that sirolimus treated the tendon calcification induced by collagenase injection and significantly improved histological scores (Fig. 8C and D). Subsequently, Gene Ontology enrichment analysis was performed on the gene expression differences between the sirolimus treatment group and the PBS group, revealing that the sirolimus treat- ment group attenuated skeletal system development and osteoblast differentiation (Fig. 8E). We constructed the protein-protein interaction network and identified key proteins in sirolimus treatment using the 8 Z. Wang et al. Computers in Biology and Medicine 186 (2025) 109665 Fig. 4.

Next, we established a connection between the models and patients using data generated from high-throughput analysis, aiming to investi- gate the effectiveness of sirolimus target in clinical tendinopathy. Firstly, we conducted an integrative pathway enrichment analysis to explore the potentially reversible human tendinopathy molecular 9 Z. Wang et al. Computers in Biology and Medicine 186 (2025) 109665 Fig. 5. Prediction of candidate drug efficacy with deep learning. signature through mTOR inhibition. Additionally, we tried to replicate human tendinopathy biological system to observe the impact of mTOR inhibition on the occurrence and progression of tendinopathy. Addi- tionally, we investigated the reliability of the collagenase model in replicating the human tendinopathy biological system to observe the impact of mTOR inhibition on the occurrence and progression of clinical tendinopathy. The therapeutic impact of inhibiting mTOR was examined in a transgenic mouse model, where the mTOR gene was selectively deacti- vated in the tendon lineage [49]. An enrichment analysis was conducted to examine the gene expression changes between the WT and mTOR-TKO mice. The analysis confirmed the validity of mTOR tendon knockout (Fig. 9A). To explore whether mTOR inhibition can treat clinical tendinopathy, we performed an integrative transcriptional analysis across species. We leveraged differential expression analysis data in tendinopathy patients and mTOR-TKO mice versus healthy control, respectively. The pathway analysis was instructed to prioritize tendinopathy/mTOR-inhibition opposed feature pairs. The major findings involved the processes and pathways of cytoplasmic translation, cytoskeletal protein binding and bone morphology (Fig. 9B). We further observed the effect of mTOR inhibition on the occurrence and development of tendinopathy in vivo. Firstly, we demonstrated that the collagenase injection model faithfully replicates the molecular signature of clinical tendinopathy. In order to determine the extent of similarity in gene expression between patients with tendinopathy and the collagenase model, we employed RRHO analysis to compare their transcriptional signatures. Our findings showed a substantial overlap (P- (cid:0) 109) in the genes that were typically upregulated or value = 1.9 × 10 downregulated, as depicted in Fig. 9C. Furthermore, our research revealed common transcriptional alterations across individuals with tendinopathy and the collagenase model (log2Foldchange >2 & p < 10 Z. Wang et al.

The enrichment of overlap differential genes involved “Extracel- lular matrix organization”, “Endochondral ossification” and “Bone mineralization” (Fig. 9D). Subsequently, collagenase was administered by injection into the Achilles tendon of both wild-type (WT) mice and mTOR-TKO mice. Histological staining results showed mTOR-TKO mice exhibited enhanced resistance to tendinopathy. These findings confirmed that sirolimus had strong potential for reversing clinical tendinopathy. 4.

Thirdly, sirolimus performed excellently in deep learning based drug efficacy prediction. Fourthly, genetically predicted plasma levels of downstream proteins inhibited by sirolimus increased tendin- opathy risk. Fifthly, after sirolimus treatment, the motor function and histological score of animal models were significantly improved. Sixthly, mTOR-TKO mice exhibited enhanced resistance to tendinopathy. The significance of our findings is especially relevant for patients suffering from calcific tendinopathy. Through integrative pathway enrichment analysis, we identified the clinical tendinopathy pathways that can be reversed by mTOR inhibition. A substantial enrichment of the bone morphology-related pathways indicated that sirolimus may provide potential therapeutic benefits in ameliorating heterotopic ossification in clinical tendinopathy. Despite the high prevalence and incidence of tendinopathy, effective methods for disease relief are currently lacking. Severe tendinopathy can be treated with surgical interventions, but the outcomes are often unsatisfactory [50]. Conventional drug treatments are limited to symptomatic relief, with uncertain efficacy [51]. Our results highlight the potential clinical application of currently available FDA-approved mTOR inhibitors, which could potentially be repurposed for conserva- tive treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy, fundamentally slowing the progression of tendinopathy.

Our results highlight the potential clinical application of currently available FDA-approved mTOR inhibitors, which could potentially be repurposed for conserva- tive treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy, fundamentally slowing the progression of tendinopathy. We employed many methodologies to offer a holistic outlook on pharmacological repurposing. Transcriptomics drug prediction is based on the principle of signature reversion (SRP), which assumes that if a treatment can reverse the expression pattern of genes that are charac- teristic of a specific disease phenotype, then it may have the ability to reverse the disease phenotype itself [8]. SRP has effectively been utilized to discover new possibilities for repurposing drugs across several fields of therapy [52–54]. However, the drug-perturbed transcriptomics pro- files are obtained from cells [55]. This is perhaps the most fundamental limitation in transcriptomics drug prediction, as much of physiology and pharmacology is non-cell-autonomous. We applied systematic review to supplement the evidence of drugs at the level of tissues and humans. The focused attention on drugs supported by clinical evidence allowed us to efficiently identify candidate drugs. However, it inevitably led to the omission of certain drugs. MR provides a rapid and affordable approach to evaluating causal questions [56]. Genetic variants in MR are used as instrumental variables to examine the possible impact of drug target on disease outcomes in large observational datasets. These variants can be seen as proxies for an intervention on the drug target [57]. However, there is a difference between genetic effect and pharmacological effect. Genetic variants that represent the effects of drugs are the result of tiny changes in drug targets over a person’s lifetime. This is different from a pharmacological intervention in later life, which usually has a larger effect but for a shorter duration [35]. It is for exactly this reason that MR estimates of genetically proxied drug effects are typically greater in magnitude than those observed in clinical practice [58]. Although these restraints make the effectiveness of sirolimus warrants further investi- gation, the consistency between findings supports the robustness of our conclusions. The goal of systems biology is to comprehend physiology and disease from the level of molecules, pathways, cells, tissues, organs and ulti- mately the whole organism [10]. Our drug repurposing strategy employs diverse approaches that span multiple levels to adequately consider the biological complexity of tendinopathy. Three principal approaches in systems biology are plenarily employed in this study: large-scale data 13 generation and mining; in silico simulation; and the use of complex biological systems to assay and model biology [9]. Firstly, the generated profiling data from high-throughput analysis was utilized to: 1) define molecular characteristics of tendinopathy, 2) acquire genetic association data and predict the causal relationship between tendinopathy and drug targets, and 3) establish comprehensive connections between animal models and patients. Secondly, complementary in silico simulations enabled us to integrate diverse information, leading to a sophisticated candidate drug list.

Thirdly, we took biological responses as a corner- stone in drug prediction (drug-perturbed transcriptomics profiles from cells) and drug verification (biological system recapitulation, cross-species integration analysis). Nevertheless, this study has some limitations. Our tendinopathy samples were from the rotator cuff, while healthy samples were from the Achilles tendon. The ideal control for this study would have been a matched number of healthy supraspinatus tendon samples; however, in clinical practice, opportunities to collect these samples without impacting patient health are extremely rare. This study conducted a large-scale (n > 100) transcriptome analysis of clinical tendinopathy patients, involving only a single-center cohort of RCT patients. There- fore, the lack of reliable RNA-seq datasets from other sources limits the reproducibility of tendinopathy gene signatures. Besides, we did not consider the disease heterogeneity of tendinopathy. Additional investi- gation is necessary to examine the clinical characteristics and molecular classifications of patients who may experience positive outcomes from sirolimus treatment. 5. Conclusions Our study assimilates knowledge of system-level responses to iden- tify potential drugs for tendinopathy. Sirolimus, a commonly used mTOR inhibitor with a recognized safety profile, has the potential to be repurposed for the treatment of tendinopathy. This could offer a quick road to clinical application. Drug repositioning based on systems biology identifies and targets biologically significant pathways that are essential and can be effectively addressed with pharmacological interventions. We have presented a approach for the repositioning of medications and the development of therapies that are tailored to specific diseases based on their characteristics.

However, the causal effect of mTOR downstream proteins on NAFLD remains unknown. Aims: We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to investigate whether the mTOR-dependent circulating proteins, including Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 4E Binding Proteins (eIF4EBPs), Ribosomal Protein S6K kinase 1 (RP-S6K), Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 4E (eIF4E), Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 4A (eIF4A) and Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 4 G (eIF4G), have causal effects on the risk of NAFLD. Methods: The causal estimate was evaluated with the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method in discov- ery stage and validation stage. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected to genetically predict exposures from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). Exposures with statistically signiﬁcant effects in the discovery dataset would be further validated in the validation dataset. Results: MR study revealed that eIF4E had a causal effect on NAFLD in both discovery stage (OR = 1.339, P = 0.037) and validation stage (OR = 1.0 0 07, P = 0.022). Sensitivity analyses conﬁrmed robustness of the results. Conclusion: The genetically predicted higher level of mTOR-dependent eIF4E in plasma might have a causal effect on the occurrence of NAFLD. © 2023 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

Incidence of NAFLD rises with increased living standards, changed eating habits and lifestyles, threatening nearly a quarter of the global population. If not treated, NAFLD tends to develop severe liver damage, 25 % of which would progress to liver ﬁbrosis and 1.5 %−8 % of which would progress to liver cirrhosis, even hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [2 , 3] . How- ever, the pathogenesis of NAFLD remains unclear. Currently, there is still no clinical intervention approved by the Food and Drug Ad- ministration (FDA) for NAFLD. Thus, further exploration of NAFLD pathogenesis and ﬁnding novel therapeutic targets remain topics of intense research.

Therefore, this ren- ders mTORC1 an attractive target to regulate the lipid homeostasis of livers. However, existing studies reached conﬂicting conclusions [7–9] . This indicates a complex role of mTORC1 in NAFLD, which remains poorly understood. The function of mTORC1 is dominantly regulated by the phos- phorylation of downstream proteins, mainly including Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 4E Binding Proteins (eIF4EBPs) and Ribosomal Pro- tein S6K kinase 1 (RP-S6K). eIF4EBP is a binding protein of Eu- karyotic Initiation Factor 4E (eIF4E).

Ethical approval can be found in the original literature, and we used publicly available statistics. For IVs, we selected signiﬁcant genetic variants associated with mTORC1-dependent circulating proteins from the GWAS (signiﬁ- cant P < 5 × 10−6 ). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) describes correla- tions of genetic variants, which were due to the distance of phys- ical locations. To ensure the selected SNPs were independent for each exposure, LD was satisﬁed in the given region (R2 < 0.05, kb > 10,0 0 0). SNPs of palindromic structures were eliminated. Cragg-Donald F-statistic was used to evaluate the power of SNPs. SNPs of F < 10 would be considered weak instruments [18] . 2.2. Summarized statistics of NAFLD We extracted two summarized GWAS statistics of NAFLD, de- ﬁned as the discovery dataset and validation dataset respectively.

For the val- idation dataset, statistics were obtained from UK Biobank (UKB, https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk ) with 361,194 samples, adjusting for sex, age, and the ﬁrst 20 principal components. For the remaining IVs, we used PhenoScanner ( https://phenoscanner.medschl.cam.ac. uk ) to ﬁnd possible correlations with NAFLD. We imputed the re- maining IVs associated with each exposure to determine associa- tions with NAFLD and confounders. Ethical approvals can be found in each GWAS. In FinnGen Biobank, the FinnGen team conducted the GWAS, and FinnGen Steering Committee approved the study. In UKB, Neale Lab performed the GWAS and the Ethics Advisory Com- mittee of the UKB approved the study. We used the publicly avail- able summarized statistics, and all the data can be downloaded without restriction. 2.3. MR design Being as effective IVs, genetic variants need to be met with the following three core assumptions. (i) Genetic variants are as- sociated with mTORC1-dependent circulating proteins. (ii) Genetic variants are independent of confounders that have an impact on NAFLD and may affect the “exposure-outcome” association. (iii) Genetic variants affect NAFLD only by each exposure. The effect of an SNP on an outcome and exposure must be harmonized to be relative to the same allele. After harmonizing, a two-sample MR will be performed. When assessing causal effects between mTORC1-dependent circulating proteins and NAFLD, the summa- rized statistics of NAFLD from the discovery dataset FinnGen were initially used. Exposures with statistically signiﬁcant effects in the discovery dataset would be further validated in the validation dataset UKB. If statistically signiﬁcant effects were found in both the discovery dataset and validations dataset, the exposure could be considered to have causal effects with NAFLD. The MR ﬂowchart is shown in Fig. 2 . 2.4. Statistical analysis and sensitivity analysis Due to the highest estimating eﬃcacy, the Inverse Variance Weighted method was initially used for the MR analysis, and a random-effect model was applied. In IVW, based on the association of IVs on exposures and the outcome, Wald estimates were calcu- lated, the variance of which was then used as weights to integrate each Wald estimates [19] . In addition, we performed the following MR methods as supplementary analysis of IVW. (i) Egger’s regres- sion for MR, where the horizontal pleiotropy was assumed to exist. Fig. 1.

Main proteins of mTORC1 are present in Fig. 1 . Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are regarded as the opti- mal type of design for evaluating causal effects. However, restricted by medical ethics, subject compliance, study period, and other fac- tors, appropriate RCTs are diﬃcult to implement in many cases. Mendelian Randomization (MR) is a statistical model using genetic variation as Instrumental Variables (IVs), which is widely applied in causal inference in recent years [13] . IVs are usually obtained from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). During gametoge- nesis, genetic variants underwent random segregation and combi- nations. MR capitalizes on this feature of genetic variants to sim- ulate the random allocation of the population. When an individ- ual was born, randomly allocated genetic variants affecting speciﬁc phenotypes had been already determined. This process is com- monly unrelated to acquired environmental confounders. Thus, dif- ferences in the speciﬁc outcome of the population with or without such genetic variants can be attributed to exposures, thereby ruling out interferences of confounders [14] . In this study, we performed an MR study to investigate the causal effect between the risk of NAFLD and mTORC1-dependent circulating protein levels, including eIF4EBPs, eIF4A, eIF4E, eIF4G, and RP-S6K. Considering the role of mTORC1 in regulating lipid homeostasis and oxidation of the liver, we hypothesized that mTORC1-dependent circulating protein levels had a causal effect on NAFLD. 2. Method 2.1. Summarized statistics of mTORC1-dependent proteins Deﬁned as exposures, we applied 5 different mTORC1- dependent circulating proteins, including eIF4EBPs, eIF4A, eIF4E, eIF4G, and RP-S6K. SNPs related to the mTORC1-dependent pro- teins were obtained from a recent proteomics GWAS of Euro- pean participants, the INTERVAL study ( https://www.phpc.cam.ac. uk/ceu/proteins ) [15 , 16] . In this genomic bioresource, 50,0 0 0 blood donors from 25 centers across England were recruited from 2012 to 2014.

MR-PRESSO tests the existence of pleiotropy by removing outlier SNPs and estimating corrected results, thus testing the difference before and after the removal of outlier SNPs [22] . To acquire results of authenticity, the number of bootstrap replications was set at 10,0 0 0. In addition, we performed multivariable MR analysis in the validation stage to further verify the robustness of the results. Considering potential heterogeneity, pleiotropy, and the problem of collinearity of each exposure, a following Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) feature selection method was utilized to select features and only retain relevant features and instruments, thus perform- ing multivariable MR on remaining data [23] . Statistical analysis and sensitivity analysis were performed using the R software ( https://r-project.org ), version 4.2.2, with “TwoSampleMR” and “MRPRESSO” packages. The ﬁgures were drawn by Figdraw ( https://www.ﬁgdraw.com/static/index.html#/ ) and the R software. 3. Result 3.1. MR analysis of eIF4E and RP-S6K in discovery stage Of 135 SNPs associating eIF4E, 117 variants were removed due to LD with other variants or absence from LD reference panel. After merging clumped SNPs and GWAS of FinnGen, 16 SNPs remained, and 2 variants rs531476076 and rs7862784 were removed for be- ing palindromic with intermediate allele frequencies. IVW method indicated that eIF4E protein level in plasma was statistically associ- ated with a higher risk of NAFLD with OR of 1.339, P-value of 0.037. MR-Egger (OR = 1.417, P-value = 0.269) and WM (OR = 1.411, P- value = 0.068) methods did not show opposite results. Of 181 SNPs associating RP-S6K, 160 variants were removed due to LD with other variants or absence from LD reference panel. After merging, 18 SNPs remained and 3 variants rs17412698, rs74353857, and rs79549584 were removed for being palindromic with in- termediate allele frequencies. No statistical association was found between RP-S6K protein level in plasma and NAFLD using IVW (OR = 1.162, P-value = 0.219) and MR-Egger (OR = 1.042, P- value = 0.863) methods. However, WM method (OR = 1.389, P- value = 0.041) showed a higher risk of NAFLD with RP-S6K protein level in plasma. To further validate the results mentioned above, eIF4E and RP- S6K protein levels in plasma will be included in the validation dataset to further test the causal effect on NAFLD.

All of IVW, MR-Egger, and WM methods did not show statistically signiﬁcant association between eIF4EBPs, eIF4A, and eIF4G protein levels in plasma and the risk of NAFLD. Given the above results, eIF4EBPs, eIF4A, and eIF4G will not further test in the validation dataset. Results of MR analysis were presented in Table 1 . 3.3. MR analysis of eIF4E and RP-S6K in validation stage Due to the different source of the validation dataset, remain- ing SNPs got different sections from those in discovery stage. Af- ter merging clumped SNPs and GWAS of UKB, 8 SNPs remained associating eIF4E and 16 SNPs remained associating RP-S6K. Sim- ilar results were successfully obtained. Results in validation stage aligned with the discovery stage. IVW method showed that eIF4E protein level in plasma (Beta = 3.028 × 10−4 , P-value = 0.022) was associated with a higher risk of NAFLD, while RP-S6K protein level (Beta = 1.598 × 10−4 , P-value = 0.12) in plasma was not.

The causal effect of RP-S6K and NAFLD remains ambiguous. Results in validation stage were shown in supplementary Table S1, and scatterplots were present in Fig. 3 . 3.4. Sensitivity analysis Heterogeneity and pleiotropy tests of the discovery stage and validation stage were shown in Table 1 and supplementary Ta- ble S1. Apart from eIF4EBPs (P-value = 0.04) and eIF4G (P- value = 0.033), no heterogeneity was found across exposures in both stages using Cochrane Q Test. The source of heterogeneity was considered the low sample size, leading to a small number of se- lected SNPs. MR-PRESSO and MR-Egger methods were applied for the pleiotropy test. Through MR-PRESSO method, the robustness of re- sults was pruned by correcting outlier SNPs of each exposure. No outlier SNPs were found across all exposures in both discovery and validation stages. This abolished the effects of heterogeneity men- tioned above. However, pleiotropy was found in eIF4EBP with an MR-PRESSO P-value of 0.047. Besides, through MR-Egger methods, an intercept of each exposure was returned reﬂecting the size of pleiotropy ( Fig. 3 ). There was no statistically signiﬁcant pleiotropy existing across all exposures except eIF4G, with an MR-Egger inter- cept of −0.135 and a P-value of 0.049. Forrest plots of multivariable MR analysis were shown in Fig. 4 . Before LASSO feature selection, no statistical signiﬁcance was found across all exposures, although there was a strong trend toward signiﬁcance in eIF4E (P-value = 0.069). After LASSO fea- ture selection, eIF4E showed the statistically signiﬁcant causal ef- fect on NAFLD once again, with a P-value of 0.0188. Multiple meth- ods demonstrated that this causal effect of eIF4E on NAFLD was of well robustness and stability. 4. Discussion To the best of our knowledge, this study is the ﬁrst to examine the potential causal effect of mTORC1-dependent circulating pro- teins and NAFLD risk through the MR approach.

Levels of eIF4EBP, eIF4A, eIF4G, and RP-S6K in plasma were not found to be causally associated with the risk of NAFLD. In addition, pleiotropy and heterogeneity were not identiﬁed in our main ﬁndings through sensitivity analyses, and similar results were replicated using mul- tivariable MR analysis. This further suggested the robustness of our results. Indeed, there has been evidence for effects of mTOR on NAFLD progression. Existing data indicate that mTOR regulates NAFLD through lipid metabolism [24 , 25] , insulin resistance [26] , oxidative stress [27] , intestinal ﬂora [28] , autophagy [29] , hepatic inﬂamma- tion [30] , and liver genetic polymorphisms and epigenetics [31] . However, it has not been suﬃciently proven that the downstream proteins in mTORC1 pathway are involved. Wang et al. [32 , 33] ob- served activated mTORC1 and increased downstream proteins in- cluding eIF4E due to inﬂammation stress-induced hepatic steatosis in vivo and in vitro, and mTOR inhibition could reverse this process and lead to alleviation of hepatic steatosis. Given inﬂammation stress could result in hepatic lipid accumulation, this result was consistent with our ﬁndings. Study by Liu et al. [34] demonstrated similar results that increased mTORC1 activity along with phos- phorylated downstream proteins exacerbated the progression of NAFLD by disrupting cholesterol homeostasis, in which hepatic in- ﬂammation was induced by using 10 % casein injected apolipopro- tein E knockout mice in vivo and interleukin-1 stimulated hepG2 hepatoblastoma cell line in vitro . In another study by Liu et al. [24] , they observed that the impaired activity of mTORC1 decreased lipid droplets in hepatocytes. In parallel, restored mTORC1 activity inhibited lipophagy and lipid droplet degradation. Again, increased mTORC1 activity was observed in liver tissues of NAFLD patients by restricting hepatic lipophagy. In addition, a clinical trial con- ducted by Kubrusly et al. [35] demonstrated that the expression of downstream effector of mTORC1 including eIF4E increased in non- alcoholic steatosis hepatitis-related cirrhosis. These also provided supporting evidence for our hypothesis. Currently approved treatment for NAFLD is recommended to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors and favorable lifestyle mod- iﬁcation (hypocaloric diets, regular physical activity, weight loss, etc.). Patients suffering from NAFLD have shown improvement through such approaches. However, the pharmacotherapy for NAFLD is poor. Finding eligible targets for pharmacological treat- ment of NAFLD remains a topic of intense research. So far, re- search conducted on mTOR suggested a vast potential for study- ing mTOR as a therapeutic target for NAFLD. Study by Shen et al. [36] found that geniposide could alleviate NAFLD by suppressing the phosphorylation of mTORC1 and its related proteins in mice. Similarly, Quan et al. [37] demonstrated that mTOR and RP-S6K were reduced when hepatocytes were treated with betulinic acid, thereby ameliorating hepatic lipid accumulation. Nevertheless, sev- eral other cellular pathways are also regulated by mTORC1. It","chunk_id":"Yan et al. - 2024 - The causal effect of mTORC1-dependent circulating protein levels on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease_7","doi":"Yan et al. - 2024 - The causal effect of mTORC1-dependent circulating protein levels on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease"},{"text":"therapeutic target for NAFLD.

[37] demonstrated that mTOR and RP-S6K were reduced when hepatocytes were treated with betulinic acid, thereby ameliorating hepatic lipid accumulation. Nevertheless, sev- eral other cellular pathways are also regulated by mTORC1. It is possible to create unexpected effects by blunting the modulation of mTORC1. Thus, a recent study by Gosis et al. [38] used folliculin- deleted mice to selectively inhibit mTORC1-mediated phosphoryla- tion of the transcription factor E3/B, while other mTORC1 targets were hardly affected. Their results showed that this selected inhi- bition of mTORC1 could be a promising approach for the treatment of NAFLD. Our study found a deﬁnite causal association of eIF4E with NAFLD. Therefore, we hypothesized that selected modulation of mTORC1 targets such as eIF4E could alleviate NAFLD, and there need to be more attempts at such approach to developing speciﬁc treatments for NAFLD in the future. In this study, we performed a two-sample MR analysis. A ma- jor strength of using genetic variation as IVs is that genetic vari- ation is independent of social contexts, life habits, and other traits. This feature ensures balanced confounders in different sub- groups, theoretically avoiding effects of confounders. On the other hand, the formation of genetic variation precedes exposures, con- founders, and the progression of diseases. Therefore, exposures represented by SNPs also precede the outcomes, thus excluding reverse causality [39] . To fulﬁll the assumptions of MR design, ﬁrstly, we strictly selected IVs strongly associated with mTORC1- dependent circulating protein levels, as well as removing con- founding SNPs. IVW method was primarily adapted for its high- est power of test. MR-Egger and WM were used as supplemen- tary methods. Then, MR-Egger intercept and MR-PRESSO methods conﬁrmed little pleiotropy existing. Multiple methods of sensitivity analyses evaluated the robustness and reliability based on discov- ery stage and validation stage, and multivariable MR analysis in validation stage with LASSO-feature-selection method further con- ﬁrmed our results. Several limitations exist in this MR study. Firstly, only 3301 par- ticipants were included in the GWAS from the INTERVAL study due to the complicated technology of measuring plasma proteins. As a result, we had to increase the threshold of IVs selection with P < 5 × 10−6 instead of P < 5 × 10−8 , which might introduce a bias of weak IVs. Though there is a relatively small number of included individuals in this GWAS, it is large enough to select IVs and then perform MR study, and the threshold and sensitivity anal- yses guaranteed the authenticity of our results and conclusions. Secondly, GWAS data of NAFLD patients and mTOR-dependent cir- culating proteins was derived from European populations. Whether this causal effect of eIF4E on NAFLD is generalized to other popula- tions remains unclear. Larger GWAS from different populations and regions are needed in the future. Besides, a key question for NAFLD community is ﬁnding NAFLD severity-related SNPs and exploring 563 X. Yan, S.

However, since there is no GWAS of NAFLD severity, we cannot perform an MR study on such associations. At last, although we did not ﬁnd effects of heterogeneity and pleiotropy in our main ﬁnding through multiple methods of sensitivity analyses, the difference in the included populations does exist. Thus, potential heterogeneity and partial pleiotropy might exist. 5. Conclusion In conclusion, this two-sample MR study supports that geneti- cally predicted eIF4E protein level in plasma is causally associated with the risk of NAFLD. A novel ﬁnding of this research suggests that European ancestry populations with a higher level of mTOR- dependent eIF4E protein in plasma have a higher risk of NAFLD. Nevertheless, our conclusion is based on GWAS data, and high- quality research is required in the future to explore the detailed functional relevance and clinical utility.

However, the causality between mTOR-dependent circulating protein levels and CPP is still unclear. Our aim is to assess the effects of seven mTOR-dependent circulating protein levels on CPP using Mendelian randomization (MR). Methods: Instrumental variables (IVs) for mTOR-dependent circulating protein levels were retrieved from the proteomics-GWAS INTERVAL study and eQTLGen. The summary-level genetic datasets for CPP outcome were obtained from the FinnGen Consortium. Inverse-variance weighted (IVW) was used as the primary method and the pleiotropy, heterogeneity and robustness of the analyses were detected as sensitivity analysis. Positive exposures in the discovery cohort would be revalidated in the validation cohort. Results: This two-sample MR study revealed a causal association between eIF4G level in plasma and CPP in both discovery cohort (IVW: OR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.22–0.91, p = 0.026) and validation cohort (IVW: OR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.24– 0.85, p = 0.014). Conclusions: There was a causal association between eIF4G level in plasma and CPP. Whether eIF4G can be used for the prevention or treatment of CPP needs to be explored in further studies.

In Denmark, a statistic based on a registered population showed that the prevalence of precocious puberty was about 0.2% in girls and less than 0.05% in boys (3). Notably, precocious puberty can affect adult height and increase the risk of behavioral and psychological problems, cancer, obesity, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes (4–8). Therefore, the prevention of precocious puberty is particularly important in global public health. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/ threonine protein kinase in the PI3K-related protein kinase (PIKK) family and participates in the composition of two protein complexes named mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) (9). mTORC1 performs essential functions in the regulation of cellular anabolism and catabolism, such as lipids and nucleotides, promoting the synthesis of proteins, maintaining energy homeostasis, and inhibiting catabolism and autophagy (9). In terms of protein synthesis, mTORC1 phosphorylates two key effectors downstream named eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein (eIF4EBP) and ribosomal protein S6K kinase 1 (S6K1) to promote translation (10). Wherein phosphorylated eIF4EBP enhances 5′ cap-dependent mRNA translation by releasing eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and promoting its formation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) (11). As for mTORC2, it regulates a variety of cellular structures and functions such as cytoskeleton, metabolism, proliferation and survival by phosphorylating members of the AGC (PKA/PKG/PKC) family of protein kinases including protein kinase C-alpha (PKC-a), serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 1 (SGK1) and Akt (9, 12–14). Previous studies have found that the mTOR signaling pathway has a signiﬁcant effect on CPP. Activation of the IGF-1/Akt/mTOR pathway in the hypothalamus of prepubertal female rats increases the expression of kisspeptin protein (encoded by the Kiss-1 gene) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), resulting in an earlier puberty in female rats (15, 16). In contrast, inhibition of mTOR in the hypothalamus blocks the activation of Kiss-1, G- protein-coupled receptor GPR54 (also named Kiss1R) and GnRH (15). However, due to the lack of exploration of the relationship between downstream proteins in the mTOR signaling pathway and CPP in previous studies, the relationship between mTOR- dependent downstream proteins and CPP is currently inconclusive. Mendelian randomization (MR) is an approach of genetic epidemiology that uses genetic variants, known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as proxies for exposures of interest to explore causal relationships between exposures and outcomes (17). The advantages of MR lie in the fact that it minimizes confounders, bias, and reverse causation associated with observational studies, and is consistent with the principle of randomization in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (17). Given the important role of the mTOR signaling pathway in CPP, in the present study, we explored the effects of mTOR-dependent circulating protein (Akt, eIF4A, eIF4E, eIF4EBP, eIF4G, PKC-a and S6K1) levels on CPP using two-sample MR. 2 Materials and","chunk_id":"Ying et al. - 2024 - Causal association between mTOR-dependent circulating protein levels and central precocious puberty_1","doi":"Ying et al. - 2024 - Causal association between mTOR-dependent circulating protein levels and central precocious puberty"},{"text":"minimizes confounders, bias, and reverse causation associated with observational studies, and is consistent with the principle of randomization in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (17).

The ﬂow chart (Figure 1) shows the general design of this study. There are three assumptions that must be met in MR studies (Figure 2): (i) Genetic variants used to proxy exposure must be closely correlated with the exposure; (ii) Genetic variants are not associated with any confounders that affect the exposure-outcome relationship; (iii) Genetic variants can only impact outcomes via the target exposure. The rationale for the ability of MR studies to reduce bias is that genetic variants are randomly arranged and ﬁxed at the time of conception, and are therefore largely unaffected by confounding factors and are not altered by disease progression. 2.2 Data sources for exposure and outcome The genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets of mTOR-dependent circulating protein levels in the discovery cohort were retrieved from a publicly available proteomics- GWAS INTEVAL study, which enrolled 3,301 participants of European ancestry and measured data on 3,600 proteins (19). The cis-eQTLs of corresponding genes of the mTOR-dependent circulating proteins in the validation cohort were retrieved from eQTLGen Consortium (20). The GWAS dataset of CPP outcome including 171 cases and 361,988 controls of European ancestry were retrieved from the FinnGen Consortium (R9) (21). 2.3 Selection of instrumental variables The IVs for exposure in the discovery cohort were screened for the following conditions: (i) p < 5×10-6; (ii) linkage disequilibrium (LD) clumping (r2 < 0.001, threshold 10,000kb). The IVs for exposure in the validation cohort were screened for the following conditions: (i) p < 5×10-8; (ii) ± 250kb of the gene location; (iii) weak LD (r2 < 0.2, threshold 150 kb) to clump extracted cis-eQTLs in order to maximize the strength of the instrument for each gene. Meanwhile, all IVs in the discovery and validation cohorts need to meet F statistics (beta2/se2) (22, 23) > 10 in order to minimize weak instrumentation bias (24). Moreover, we assessed whether SNPs in screened IVs were associated with known risk factors of CPP by the PhenoScanner V2 database (http://www.phenoscanner.medschl.cam.ac.uk/).

MR-Egger regression provides MR estimates after adjustment for horizontal pleiotropy (27). When more than half of the information comes from valid instrumental variables, the WM approach produces estimates that are consistent with the actual effects (28). In this study, the results of IVW method were used as a criterion for determining whether there was a causal relationship or not, based on the premise that the results of all three methods had a consistent direction. The Inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was considered as the primary method for determining the causal relationship between exposure and outcome in this study, which is found to be more reliable in the absence of pleiotropy of IVs (26). Meanwhile, MR- In addition, several sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the pleiotropy, heterogeneity and robustness of the analyses. First, the Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO) (29) and the intercept test of MR-Egger FIGURE 2 Three core assumptions of Mendelian randomization. Frontiers in Endocrinology 03 frontiersin.org Ying et al. 10.3389/fendo.2024.1360043 (27) were applied to detect the horizontal pleiotropy, with p < 0.05 indicating the presence of horizontal pleiotropy. Second, the Cochrane Q test was applied to detect heterogeneity between genetic variants for the IVW and MR-Egger methods, where p < 0.05 indicated the presence of heterogeneity (30). Third, we visually assessed the heterogeneity among SNPs through the funnel plot. Fourth, we also performed leave-one-out sensitivity analyses to assess whether the results remained stable after excluding a particular SNP. Finally, we replicate the positive results from the discovery cohort in the validation cohort to demonstrate the robustness of the results. All statistics were two-tailed, and p value < 0.05 was taken as strong evidence for the existence of a signiﬁcant causal relationship. All statistical analyses were conducted using R version 4.3.1. 3 Results 3.1 Genetic instruments selection After rigorous screening, the numbers of eligible SNPs as IVs for mTOR-dependent circulating protein levels were as follows in the discovery cohort: 14 for Akt, 8 for eIF4A, 13 for eIF4E, 10 for eIF4EBP, 7 for eIF4G, 8 for PKC-a and 11 for S6K1. In the validation cohort, 1, 3 and 13 eligible SNPs were selected as IVs for eIF4G1, eIF4G2 and eIF4G3. Detailed information of all IVs is displayed in Supplementary Tables 1A, B. Supplementary Table 2 shows the strongly correlated phenotypic features corresponding to all SNPs used as IVs, none of which were excluded due to correlation with confounders of CPP. 3.2 Effect of mTOR-dependent circulating protein levels on CPP The MR results of the effects of seven mTOR-dependent circulating protein levels on CPP are summarized in Figure 3; Supplementary Table 3.

Speciﬁcally, we found a signiﬁcant causal relationship between the level of eIF4G in plasma and CPP. For every increase of the level of eIF4G in plasma by one standard deviation, the risk of CPP was reduced by 55% (IVW: OR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.22–0.91, p = 0.026). However, no signiﬁcant causality was found between the remaining six mTOR-dependent circulating protein levels and CPP. To verify the robustness of the above positive ﬁndings, we further explored the association between the levels of gene eIF4G in the blood and CPP. Protein eIF4G has three isoforms, named eIF4G1, eIF4G2 and eIF4G3, which are encoded by the genes eIF4G1, eIF4G2 and eIF4G3. The MR results of the effects of gene eIF4G levels in the blood on CPP are summarized in Figure 4; Supplementary Table 4. It was found that there was a signiﬁcant causal relationship between the total level of gene eIF4G in the blood as well as the level of gene eIF4G3 and CPP. For every increase of the total level of gene eIF4G and the level of gene eIF4G3 in the blood by one standard deviation, the risk of CPP was reduced by 55% (IVW: OR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.24–0.85, p = 0.014) and 68% (IVW: OR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.16–0.63, p = 0.001), respectively. While no signiﬁcant causality was found between the level of gene eIF4G1 in the blood as well as eIF4G2 and CPP. Such results were consistent with the discovery cohort, and furthermore, it was identiﬁed that it was gene eIF4G3 that played a major role in preventing CPP.

It was conﬁrmed by MR-PRESSO and intercept test of MR-Egger results (p > 0.05) that there was no horizontal pleiotropy in all analyses of this study. Meanwhile, all the Cochrane Q test results were negative (p > 0.05) and no sig niﬁcant asymmetry was found in the funnel plot (Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 2), which suggested that there was no signiﬁcant heterogeneity among the SNPs used as IVs in this study. Finally, as demonstrated by the results of the leave-one-out analysis (Supplementary Figure 3, Supplementary Figure 4), none of the SNPs signiﬁcantly affected the causality between the positive exposures (the level of circulating protein eIF4G, the total level of gene eIF4G in the blood and the level of gene eIF4G3 in the blood) and CPP, which further validated the robustness","chunk_id":"Ying et al. - 2024 - Causal association between mTOR-dependent circulating protein levels and central precocious puberty_4","doi":"Ying et al. - 2024 - Causal association between mTOR-dependent circulating protein levels and central precocious puberty"},{"text":"as IVs in this study.

This MR study provided strong evidence of a signiﬁcant negative correlation between mTOR- dependent circulating protein eIF4G level and the risk of CPP. However, there was no evidence of a causal relationship between the levels of the remaining mTOR-dependent circulating proteins (Akt, eIF4A, eIF4E, eIF4EBP, PKC-a and S6K1) and CPP. Premature activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is the key to CPP, behind which the leptin-mTOR-Kisspeptin pathway serves as one of the crucial pathogenic mechanisms (31). In addition to suppressing appetite and increasing energy expenditure, leptin has also been implicated as a permissive factor in the activation of GnRH neurosecretion during puberty (32). Meanwhile, Kisspeptin is a key activator of gonadotropin secretion because it induces GnRH secretion by activating GnRH neurons via direct synaptic contact or indirect trans-synaptic inputs (33, 34). Roa et al. found that inhibition of central mTOR by rapamycin attenuates the permissive effect of leptin on the onset of puberty in food-restricted female rats, while pharmacological inhibition of mTOR results in a signiﬁcant decrease in hypothalamic Kiss-1 expression (35). Therefore, mTOR acts as an energy sensor in this pathway, however, the speciﬁc molecular basis of this pathway remains unclear (31). Zhou et al. found that phthalate exposure is associated with an increased incidence of precocious puberty in girls in a case-control study, and Shao et al. found that Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) induces precocious puberty in female rats by upregulating the IGF-1/PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway (15). Several studies have also pointed out (including a RCT study) that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway or Akt1 is a key target for the prevention or treatment of precocious puberty (36–40). However, no signiﬁcant causality between Akt levels in plasma and CPP was found in our study. Such differences may arise from the different tissues examined (hypothalamus, serum, plasma or testis) as well as the fact that our study did not obtain GWAS data on the levels of different Akt isoforms in plasma, instead we explored the total levels of Akt in plasma. Two previous studies observed reduced levels of PKC expression in the hypothalamus of precocious puberty rats and in the hypothalamic GT1-7 neurons of mice after treatment with gut microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and the traditional Chinese medicine Fuyou formula, respectively (41, 42). In our study, we did not ﬁnd a causal relationship between PKC-a level in plasma and CPP, which could be attributed to differences between tissues or species.

In our study, we did not ﬁnd a causal relationship between PKC-a level in plasma and CPP, which could be attributed to differences between tissues or species. Roa et al. found that hypothalamic phosphorylated S6K1 (pS6K1) and phosphorylated S6 (pS6) are downregulated in rats with central mTOR inhibition by rapamycin, whereas the expression levels of S6K1 and S6 are unchanged (35). This is consistent with our ﬁndings, suggesting that S6K1 levels in the hypothalamus and blood may not be associated with mTOR pathway-mediated pubertal development or precocious puberty. There have been no clear reports in the past on the relationship between eIF4A, eIF4E, eIF4EBP as well as eIF4G and CPP. Frontiers in Endocrinology 05 frontiersin.org Ying et al. 10.3389/fendo.2024.1360043 We found a causal relationship between eIF4G level in plasma and CPP, suggesting that eIF4G may be a target for the prevention or treatment of CPP. Such a relationship may be related to the following facts: First, as one of the components of the eIF4F complex, eIF4G binds to eIF4E, which is separated from eIF4EBP, and functions to promote protein synthesis when the mTOR signaling pathway is activated (11). Secondly, Mezey et al. found that leptin increases the eIF4E-eIF4G complex in the liver of male rats (43). Moreover, Lynch et al. found that leptin secretion is in turn regulated by the mTOR signaling (phosphorylation of eIF4G, S6K1, rpS6, and eIF4EBP1) in vitro and in vivo (44). The onset of puberty involves complex metabolic changes, with increased anabolism being one of the manifestations, and at the same time leptin is one of the critical factors in CPP. Taken together, these evidences suggest a potential complex relationship between eIF4G and the leptin-mTOR axis as well as CPP. We consider that ﬁrstly eIF4G level in plasma can be used as an objective basis for assessing potential disease risk in children with high risk factors of CPP (lack of exercise, vitamin D deﬁciency, poor sleep quality, exposure to endocrine disruptors and international adoption). Secondly, the causal relationship between eIF4G and CPP provides new insights into the potential mechanisms of leptin-mTOR signaling pathway in CPP. Thirdly, eIF4G is promising as a new target for the prevention or treatment of CPP. We speculate that increasing eIF4G level in plasma can help to prevent CPP when prepubertal children experience high risk factors of CPP and even help to treat CPP. However, further work is needed to reveal the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms. It is crucial to clarify the standardized reference values for eIF4G in plasma that have preventive or therapeutic signiﬁcance for CPP, to develop eIF4G modulators that meet therapeutic goals, and to clarify the timing, manner, and dosage of eIF4G modulators through further trials. As an integrator of puberty signals, sex-speciﬁc kisspeptin is a potential mechanism for the sexual dimorphism in the onset of puberty and incidence of idiopathic CPP in children (45). The hypothalamus in females expresses higher levels of kisspeptin than in males, while observational research has found that the incidence of idiopathic","chunk_id":"Ying et al. - 2024 - Causal association between mTOR-dependent circulating protein levels and central precocious puberty_6","doi":"Ying et al. - 2024 - Causal association between mTOR-dependent circulating protein levels and central precocious puberty"},{"text":"to clarify the timing, manner, and dosage of eIF4G modulators through further trials. As an integrator of puberty signals, sex-speciﬁc kisspeptin is a potential mechanism for the sexual dimorphism in the onset of puberty and incidence of idiopathic CPP in children (45). The hypothalamus in females expresses higher levels of kisspeptin than in males, while observational research has found that the incidence of idiopathic CPP is at least 10-fold higher in females than in males (45). Therefore, it is essential to differentiate males from females when exploring the mechanisms of CPP. However, due to the lack of summarized data on CPP across genders in the current studies, our study was not able to explore whether the mTOR signaling pathway or mTOR-dependent circulating proteins are equally shared in both males and females by subgroup analysis. There are several strengths in this study. First, we used genetic instruments to proxy mTOR-dependent circulating protein levels, which minimized bias and confounders. Second, we conducted the analysis in terms of both protein expression levels as well as gene expression levels, which improved the robustness of our conclusions. This study has some limitations at the same time. First, only part of mTOR-dependent downstream proteins was included in this study. mTOR downstream pathways are extensive and the relationship between other related proteins and CPP needs to be further explored in subsequent studies. Second, the genetic variants in this study all came from blood samples. Despite our attempts to obtain GWAS data for the corresponding proteins in hypothalamic tissues via GTEx Consortium, we were ultimately unable to obtain suitable instrumental variables. Third, the eQTLs and GWAS data are derived from European population, which makes our conclusions lack universality. Fourth, as mentioned above, CPP differs between males and females to some extent, and our study did not involve subgroup analysis of gender or different clinical picture. Fifth, the INTEVAL study included only 3,301 participants making it impossible to detect as many genome-wide important genetic variants as possible. Therefore, we chose the looser threshold p < 5×10-6 in the context of balancing statistical efﬁcacy rather than the commonly used GWAS signiﬁcance level p < 5×10-8. Sixth, the CPP outcome data from FinnGen Consortium has a relatively small number of cases and larger data of CPP are needed for further validation in the future. 5 Conclusion This two-sample MR study supports a causal association between eIF4G level in plasma and CPP. eIF4G level in plasma can be used as an objective basis for assessing potential disease risk in children with high risk factors of CPP. However, whether eIF4G is involved in the leptin-mTOR signaling pathway in CPP and whether it can be used for the prevention or treatment of CPP need to be explored in further studies.

However, a causal association has not been fully elucidated. Men- delian randomization (MR) is used to overcome limitations inherent to observational studies, assess the causal association, and minimize bias due to confounding and reverse causation. Methods: To explore the causal association between seven mTOR-dependent proteins (AKT, Yao-Chen Zhang and Ke-Yi Fan contributed equally to this work.

Keywords: Multiple randomization protein; Molecular epidemiology sclerosis; Mendelian analysis; mTOR-associated Key Summary Points Why carry out this study The risk of multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with several potential inﬂuencing factors at the molecular level. Mendelian analysis was conducted to assess whether there was a causal association between a number of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent circulating proteins and MS. What has been learned from the study The results indicate that the relationship between two mTOR-related targets (PKC-a and RP-S6K) and MS risk is causal. These two mTOR-related targets might be used as therapeutic targets for screening high-risk individuals. INTRODUCTION Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inﬂammatory- neurodegenerative disease of the central ner- that causes a range of vous system (CNS) symptoms, such as blurred vision, weak limbs, tingling sensations, dizziness, and fatigue [1]. Discrete episodes of neurologic dysfunction may be relapses, ﬂares, attacks, or exacerba- tions, which may have very devastating effects on the brainstem and spinal cord, resulting in poor recovery. Even in the advanced stages, patients’ symptoms can be vague, although axonal injury has been caused [2]. Thus, detecting the condition as early as possible is very important. of target The mechanistic rapamycin (mTOR) is a 289-kDa serine/threonine protein kinase that serves as a downstream effector of the PI3K/AKT pathway [3]. It is a primary com- two distinct protein complexes: ponent of rapamycin-sensitive mTORC1 and rapamycin- insensitive mTORC2. mTORC1 is generally activated in response to various extracellular and intracellular stimuli, including hormones, growth factors, cytokines, oxidants, and amino acids, which occur on lysosomal membranes [4]. This kinase regulates protein translation via the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RP-S6K) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein (eIF4E-BP) [5]. eIF4E-BP inhibits translation initiation by sequestering translation factor eIF4E from the eIF4F complex (eIF4E, eIF4G and eIF4A) [6]. mTORC2 is acti- vated by PI3K-mediated growth factors signal- ing, and it phosphorylates AGC kinases, such as protein kinase B (AKT), protein kinase C-alpha (PKC-a), serum and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 1 (SGK1), to promote cell growth and cell proliferation [7] (Fig. 1). The associations between MS and the mTOR, as revealed from epidemiological studies, have recently attracted much attention [3]. However, the role of mTOR in the progression of MS is still controversial. For example, Mohammadar- ian Akbari et al. [8] found that patients with MS had a lower expression of mTOR-associated long noncoding RNAs such as SNHG5 and DANCR.

The core components of the regulatory network can regulate apoptosis, autophagy, protein synthesis, and proliferation, resulting in neuronal axon loss and demyelination of the central nervous system by complex mechanisms. RP-S6K Ribosomal protein S6, eIF4E-BP eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein, AKT protein kinase B, PKC-a protein kinase C-alpha, SGK1 serum and glucocorticoid- induced protein kinase 1 modulate a variety of immune-related micro- RNAs, such as miR-205-5p, miR-154-5p, and miR-26a-5p [9], while DANCR can induce the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) in monocytes, which in turn are involved in the autoimmune response of MS. In contrast, Fahimeh Akbarian et al. [10] reported a higher expression of mTOR-related signals (mTOR, RPS6KB1, and EIF4EBP1) in relapsing–remitting MS. It is still uncertain whether there is a causal relationship between MS and mTOR. However, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is a powerful tool for predicting the relationships between two variables. Alleles are both inde- pendently segregated and randomly assigned at meiosis, and are independent of environmental or lifestyle factors, thus producing less potential confounding and biases. Based on the widely researched genome-wide association studies (GWAS), SNPs were used to stimulate the effects of exposures [11. In the present study, we used GWAS summary statistics to perform Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to estimate the impact of mTOR signals on MS risk. METHODS The MR analysis was performed by following the STROBE-MR guidelines [12]. Informed con- sent and ethics approval were not required for the current study, as the data were obtained from the original studies [13, 14]. All procedures performed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional research commit- tee and with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. Study Design This was a two-sample MR analysis based on GWAS data, and SNPs were chosen to stimulate the effects of exposures [11]. Several assump- tions for accuracy were made. First, the genetic variants selected as instrumental variables (IVs) 754 Neurol Ther (2023) 12:751–762 should be signiﬁcantly associated with mTOR- dependent circulating proteins. Second, IVs should not be associated with any confounding factors. Third, IVs should only affect the risk of MS via mTOR-dependent proteins [12] (Fig. 2). Data Sources Effects for SNPs associated with MS were derived from the GWAS meta-analysis of the Interna- tional Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (47,429 patients and 68,374 controls of Euro- pean descent), revealing 200 non-major histo- compatibility complex (MHC) loci associated with MS [13].

Genetic datasets of genetic pre- dictors of mTOR-dependent circulating proteins (AKT, RP-S6K, eIF4E-BP, eIF4A, eIF4E, eIF4G, and PKC-a) were found in the INTERVAL study, which contains genetic associations with 2994 plasma proteins from 3301 healthy individuals of European descent (2481 and 820 individuals in the two sub-cohorts) [14]. Selection of IVs An initial signiﬁcance threshold was set using independent variants in linkage disequilibrium (r2 \\ 0.001) as the standard (p \\ 1e-5). Consid- ering multiple comparison corrections, a Bon- ferroni correction was applied, and the low p \\ 1e-5 was set. SNPs with effect allele fre- quencies \\ 0.01 (minor frequency [MAF] \\ 0.01) were removed. Moreover, the F- statistic overall and for each SNP was examined allele to measure the strength of the IVs, where F = R2(N - 2)/(1 - R2), R2 refers to the variance explained by selected SNPs, and N refers to the number of sample size [15]. SNPs with F-statistic \\ 10 were excluded from further analyses to remove the weak instrument bias.

The circulating level of vita- min D [16], sunlight exposure, obesity [17], age, sex, drinking, and smoking [18] were considered as confounding factors of MS, and any relevant instrument was excluded. to Statistical Methods All analyses were implemented in R (version 4.0.5) using TwoSampleMR packages (version 0.5.6) and MRPRESSO packages (version 1.0) (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The effect allele of each genetic variant was aligned and matched so that each sequence read could only match with one allele. Sum- (standard mary statistics’ beta coefﬁcients errors) were converted into odds ratios (ORs) with 95% conﬁdence intervals (95% CIs) for further analysis. Causal estimates were pre- inverse variance sented using three models: weighted (IVW), weighted median estimator (WME), and MR-Egger regression methods (MR- ER). Sensitivity analyses were then performed.

RESULTS All SNPs that strongly and independently pre- dicted exposures and outcomes were extracted and initially controlled for quality. After har- monization, the number of SNPs that remained for the MR analyses ranged from 8 to 12 (Elec- tronic [ESM] Tables 1–7; Fig. 3). The MR estimates using conventional MR analysis are given in Fig. 4, and the results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 and Table 1. Supplementary Material As shown in the ﬁgures, the circulating level of PKC-a was associated with a lower risk of MS (OR 0.90, 95% CI (0.82, 0.98; P = 0.017) in the IVW model. However, the estimates from the WME and MR-ER models showed no signiﬁcant association (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.84, 1.07; P = 0.385 and OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.74, 1.28; P = 0.840, respectively). Moreover, heterogene- ity in the sensitivities was not observed (Q = 10.657, PQ = 0.472). No horizontal pleio- tropy was detected (ER intercept = - 0.012; P = 0.552). The results from the leave-one-out analysis revealed that no single SNP strongly or reversely inﬂuenced the overall effect of expo- sure on the outcome (P [ 0.05; ESM Fig. 1). removing two SNPs For RP-S6K, MR estimates were recalculated after (rs482759 and rs62143197) that were identiﬁed as outliers using MR-PRESSO. The IVW method showed that the circulating level of RP-S6K was causally associated with MS (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.00, 1.25; P = 0.045). No heterogeneity (Q = 8.995, PQ = 0.253) or horizontal pleiotropy (ER inter- cept = - 0.004; P = 0.871) was detected. For eIF4G, ER indicated signiﬁcant pleio- tropy (ER intercept = -0.067; P = 0.040). The circulating level of eIF4G was associated with a higher risk of MS (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.19, 2.36; P = 0.018) using MR-ER, and no heterogeneity (Q = 7.076, PQ = 0.457). However, no signiﬁcant causation was found using the IVW or WME methods. The MR analyses showed no evidence of signiﬁcant causal associations between the other four targets and MS, including AKT (IVW: OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.96–1.18; P = 1.177), eIF4E-BP (IVW: OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.90–1.20; P = 0.593), eIF4A (IVW: OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95–1.10’ P = 0.591), and eIF4E (IVW: OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92–1.07, P = 0.786).

The present results appear to provide strong evidence in support of the inferred association between MS and mTOR. Compared with con- ventional observational epidemiological stud- ies, the inﬂuence of confounders and reverse causality were minimized in our study and, consequently, there was less potential con- founding and fewer biases produced. Mean- while, we used summary statistics from GWAS studies that have been used in several MR studies [23, 24]. The large sample size of the two selected samples and the high number of cita- tions provide a high credibility to our results. The role of mTOR in the progression of MS is still controversial. Accordingly, we found that mTOR bidirectionally regulates the risk of MS. Some researchers have reported that inhibition 756 Neurol Ther (2023) 12:751–762 Fig. 3 Flow diagram of the selection of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genetic variants used in the analysis. AKT, RP-S6K, eIF4E-BP, eIF4A, eIF4E, eIF4G, and PKC-a are the mTOR-related proteins evaluation. GWAS Genome-wide association study selected for of mTOR would curtail protein synthesis. Rapamycin targeting of mTOR could elicit responses resembling starved cells and block cells from processing beyond the G1 phase [25, 26]. mTOR has been associated with the regu- lation of axonogenesis and cellular morpho- genesis during neuronal differentiation [27], both processes providing resistance to the pro- cession of MS. Among these mTOR-related proteins, PKC-a, a downstream signaling mole- cule of TREM2 and PLCc2, is a growth-associ- ated protein after nerve damage; can modulate cytoskeletal reorganization and affect the function of the microglia and macrophages [28]. Based on these features, PKC modulators are used as a novel therapy for neuroinﬂam- matory and neurodegenerative diseases [29]. This is consistent with our ﬁndings. In our it study, PKC-a was demonstrated to be a protec- tive factor for MS. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is associated with autophagy and apoptosis, and autophagy has signiﬁcant effects on neurons and astrocytes [30]. RP-S6K, the upstream regulator of mTORC1, has been shown to affect the CNS by mediating autophagy and apoptosis [3] during which reactive oxygen is involved in oxidative stress, leading to neuronal axon loss and demyelination during MS [31]. In the present study, we consider RP-S6K to be a risk factor for MS, which is consistent with the ﬁndings reported in other studies; for example, rapa- mycin can inhibit MS by increasing Teff and decreasing Treg levels [30].

Some researchers the have demonstrated that nutrient response pathway deﬁned by mTOR is a target to extend lifespan [32] and that activa- tion of autophagy plays a central role in the process, which has been linked to neurodegen- erative diseases [33]. In addition, mTOR was identiﬁed to control the senescence-associated secretory phenotype [34]. From another aspect, aging is the most important determinant of disability worsening in MS [35, 36], and clinical and subclinical disease activity decreases with aging [37]. there is evidence showing that the onset of relapsing–remitting MS has increased over the past ﬁve decades [38]. We speculate that the age at onset plays a role in the relationship between mTOR-related targets and MS risk. Subgroup analysis based on age, classiﬁcation of diseases, and disease severity In addition, was absent from the present study, but we are convinced that future studies on these variables would give further, relevant insight into MS. Although it is apparent that mTOR-related proteins are not effective prevention strategies for MS, they may be used as an objective basis for individuals with strong MS family history to assess the potential risk of disease [3, 8, 10]. Limitations Our ﬁndings demonstrate for the ﬁrst time a causal relationship between mTOR and MS. limitations. However, our study has several First, although sensitivity analyses were con- ducted, the possibility of residual pleiotropy could not be excluded completely. Pleiotropy was detected in the analysis between eIF4G and MS, and the outliers could not be identiﬁed by 758 Neurol Ther (2023) 12:751–762 Fig. 5 Funnel plots for mTOR-related proteins (AKT, RP-S6K, eIF4E-BP, eIF4A, eIF4E, eIF4G, and PKC-a) on MS to access bias. The MR estimate for each SNP is corrected plotted against its minor-allele frequency association with mTOR-related proteins. The vertical lines show the results of IVW or MR-ER using all SNPs MR-PRESSO, which might be due to potential confounding factors [22]. Thus, we believe the causation between eIF4G and MS was not meaningful. Second, data sources limit the number of mTOR-related proteins, and only seven proteins in the mTOR family were enrol- led in the analysis. Third, since a few SNPs were selected using a threshold (p \\ 5e-8) according to to Bonferroni-adjustment, we relaxed it p \\ 1e-5, which could avoid the high false- negative rate [39], as portrayed in another MR study [40].
